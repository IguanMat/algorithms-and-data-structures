               FADE IN:

               EXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY

               A mountain peak dominates the landscape.

               TITLES BEGIN

               Riders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance 
               they appear to be a company of Army Cavalry Soldiers.

               CLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS

               Reveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The 
               riders are silhouetted against the rising sun as they ride 
               into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO.

               The OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops.

                                     OFFICER
                         Dis-mount!

               RIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we 
               realize that this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about 
               thirteen years of age. The "Commanding Officer" is only their 
               SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.

               One of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from 
               his horse, bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on 
               him.

                                     FIRST SCOUT
                         Herman's horsesick!

               A BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of 
               straw-colored hair and the no-nonsense expression common to 
               kids whose curiosity and appetite for knowledge exceed what 
               they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his uniform 
               with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.

                                     SCOUTMASTER
                         Chaps, don't anybody wander off. 
                         Some of the passageways in here can 
                         run for miles.

               Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.

               INT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY

               The two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the 
               temperature drops several degrees. Spiders have built huge 
               webs that get caught in the boys' hair.

               Herman appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this 
               enterprise, but he's drawn on by his companion's adventurous 
               curiosity.

                                     HERMAN
                         I don't think this is such a good 
                         idea.

               LAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward 
               its source.

               The VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their 
               source. The light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel 
               walls ahead. The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay 
               hidden.

                                     HERMAN
                         What is it?

               This is what they see:

               FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken 
               into one of the pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called "Kivas."

               The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE 
               (a Bowery Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black 
               hair that cascades over his shoulders).

               And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN 
               FELT FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would 
               be willing to bet anything that this is INDIANA JONES.

               However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by 
               the lantern's glow, we are shocked to discover that it is 
               someone else.

               We'll call him FEDORA.

               TITLES END

               The TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.

               Now we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA 
               JONES.

                                     FEDORA
                         Alfred, did you get anything yet?

                                     MAN
                         Nothing. Dig in.

               Two of the men stand and look at Roscoe who steps forward 
               holding a box in his hands.

                                     ROSCOE
                         Hey, I've got something!

               Whoops from the other men.

                                     ROSCOE
                         I got something, Garth!

               Roscoe rushes forward and gives Fedora the box. Fedora steps 
               toward a lantern resting on a rock.

                                     ROSCOE
                         I got something... I got something 
                         right here.

               More whoops from the other men.

               Fedora puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. Halfbreed 
               pushes Roscoe as he jumps with excitement. Rough Rider steps 
               forward to look at the box as Fedora opens it.

                                     ROSCOE
                              (more whoops; then)
                         Oh, look at that!
                              (more whoops)
                         We're rich! We're rich!

                                     HALFBREED
                         Shut up. Shut up.

               Fedora takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it 
               aloft. Fedora's comrades practically salivate at the sight 
               of it.

                                     ROSCOE (O.S.)
                         Well, we're rich, ain't we?!

               Indy takes off his hat and looks down at the off screen 
               action.

                                     HERMAN
                         Indy? Indy? What are they doing? 
                         Indiana? Indiana?

                                     INDY
                         Shhh!

               Fedora blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, 
               silently appraising its beauty... and its value. He seems 
               aloof from the others; somehow superior to them.

                                     HALFBREED
                         Hey, we got to find more stuff to 
                         bring back.

               Indy stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.

                                     INDY
                              (hushed; urgent)
                         It's the Cross of Coronado! Cortes 
                         gave it to him in 1521.

               Fedora continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the 
               rock next to its box and the lantern.

               Indy turns back to observe the men.

                                     INDY
                         That Cross is an important artifact. 
                         It belongs in a museum.

               A look of resolve comes into Indy's expression, and he turns 
               back toward Herman

                                     INDY
                         Run back and find the others. Tell 
                         Mister Havelock that there are men 
                         looting in the caves.

               Herman doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in 
               wide-eyed horror as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.

                                     INDY
                         Have him bring the sheriff.

               Indy matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. 
               Herman gasps.

                                     INDY
                         It's only a snake.

               Indy grabs Herman's scout scarf and pulls him closer.

                                     INDY
                         Did you hear what I said?

                                     HERMAN
                         Right. Run back. Mister Havelock. 
                         The Sheriff. What, what are you gonna 
                         do?

                                     INDY
                         I don't know... I'll think of 
                         something.

               Indy releases the scarf, gives Herman a pat and Herman dashes 
               off. Indy sees the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As 
               the Robbers continue to search for additional valuables, 
               Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of 
               the Cross...

               Fedora looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.

                                     FEDORA
                         Dig with your hands.

               Indy picks up the Cross.

                                     FEDORA (O.S.)
                         Not with your mouth.

               As Fedora stands watching the other men digging, Indy puts 
               the Cross in his pants and begins to pull himself up a rope 
               hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's feet break a wooden 
               beam, attracting the men's attention.

                                     ROSCOE
                         He's got our thing!

                                     HALFBREED
                         Get 'im!

               The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on Indy, 
               they almost knock each other over in the attempt.

               Only Fedora is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in 
               the direction of his fleeing companions -- then sets off 
               after Indy.

               EXT. THE CLIFFS - DAY

               Indy EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the 
               brightness of day.

               He pauses -- squints -- shields his eyes -- looks in all 
               directions.

                                     INDY
                         Mister Havelock! Anybody! Everybody's 
                         lost but me!

               He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. Rough 
               Rider, Halfbreed, and Roscoe are quick to appear and run 
               after him.

                                     FEDORA
                         There he is!

                                     MEN
                              (ad-libs)
                         Let's go! Let's get him! Let's go!

               Indy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES 
               are below. Indy puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES 
               for his horse, who trots over. Indy puts the Cross in his 
               belt.

               Indy PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he 
               JUMPS. But the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and 
               Indy lands flat on his feet in a standing position. The impact 
               sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his back teeth. 
               Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.

               Fedora AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see 
               Indy climb into the saddle and gallop off.

                                     INDY
                         Hyah! Hyah!

                                     ROSCOE
                         Hey! Come back here!

               Fedora puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES... and a 
               VINTAGE TRUCK AND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind 
               the Pueblo (driven by two more gang members). Now we 
               glimpse...

               THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT

               The passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's 
               wide brim. His arm is out the window, however, and we see an 
               olive-colored hand protruding from the sleeve of an expensive 
               white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in the 
               truck.

                                     PANAMA HAT
                         Come on. Get him!

               Indy SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not 
               only keep pace with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on 
               it.

               Speeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. 
               Indy crouched low and leaning forward in the saddle, his 
               heart pounding, his adrenaline pumping.

               Indy VEERS OFF in a new direction -- toward a RAILROAD TRACK.

               EXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY

               The train is barreling down the track. Indy rides up beside 
               it. He glances over his shoulder and sees the car and truck 
               gaining on him. No other choice... he LEAPS FROM HORSE TO 
               TRAIN.

               He clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as Halfbreed and Rough 
               Rider leap from the truck onto the train.

               Halfbreed tries to grab Indy, but Indy leaps onto another 
               boxcar. Halfbreed runs after him but Indy leaps from the 
               boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked on a flatcar.

               Indy loses his balance but regains it. With Halfbreed and 
               Rough Rider still running after him, Indy enters the trap 
               door of...

               INT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

               and finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the 
               car's ceiling. Several feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing 
               all manner of reptiles: Alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, 
               etc.

               Then, Halfbreed ENTERS through the trap door -- followed by 
               Rough Rider. Halfbreed grabs hold of Indy's feet, but Indy 
               kicks at him and he loses his grasp.

               Indy crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. 
               Halfbreed grabs at Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we 
               SEE large bins of squirming snakes.

               The combined weight of the three people is more than the 
               catwalk was intended for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM 
               THE CEILING.

               Everyone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. 
               Too late. SEVERAL BOLTS TEAR FREE. Halfbreed and Rough Rider 
               SCREAM... but it's Indy's end of the catwalk that DROPS 
               DOWN... PLUNGING Indy to the floor of the car.

               He lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he 
               finds himself eye-to-eye with an --

               ENORMOUS ANACONDA

               The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a 
               Tyrannosaurus Rex.

                                     INDY
                         Oh...

               Indy jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into 
               the SNAKE VAT.

                                     INDY
                         Oh... Oh...

               Hundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. Indy sinks into them. 
               They cover him. Engulf him. Almost smother him.

               Indy jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.

               Indy locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and 
               uses it to escape.

               Halfbreed, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the 
               car. He groans. Rough Rider moves to assist him.

                                     ROUGH RIDER
                         Here, let me.

               EXT. THE TRAIN - DAY

               Indy stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. 
               Suddenly he looks worried as he frantically reaches into his 
               shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM IT and tosses it away.

               Roscoe APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab Indy. 
               Indy kicks at him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile 
               car as Indy moves on to...

               EXT. A FLATCAR - DAY

               Indy climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. Roscoe 
               follows, grabbing a long stick with a hook on it. He reaches 
               forward and trips Indy, who falls onto the roof of the rhino 
               boxcar.

               INT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

               As a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's 
               fall, hitting a HUGE BLACK RHINOCEROS.

               EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

               Roscoe grabs Indy by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. 
               The two struggle, rolling from side to side, coming perilously 
               close to rolling right off the edge. Things get even more 
               serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.

               IN THE BOXCAR BELOW

               ...THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated 
               by the commotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises 
               his head and THRUSTS HIS HORN THROUGH THE ROOF.

               BACK TO THE ROOFTOP

               As the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from Indy's 
               head. Indy and Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they 
               continue to struggle. SMASH! The horn comes up again -- RIGHT 
               BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS.

                                     INDY
                         Holy smokes!

               Indy kicks Roscoe away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car 
               but keeps from falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach.

               EXT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

               The WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from 
               within. The door is pushed open and Halfbreed and Rough Rider 
               hurry out of the car.

               EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

               Indy gets to his feet -- looks ahead -- sees a WATER TANK 
               alongside the track directly up ahead. Indy gets an idea...

               In an instant, he calculates his approach -- times the 
               distance -- and LEAPS for the tank's WATER SPOUT.

               He catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water 
               spout to ROTATE A FULL 360 DEGREES. With Indy hanging on, 
               feet kicking, the water spout deposits him back on the train, 
               onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks up to see Fedora 
               walking toward him.

                                     FEDORA
                         Come on, kid. There's no way out of 
                         this.

               As Indy edges away from Fedora, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S 
               ROOF COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.

               INT. THE STOCKCAR - DAY

               Indy CRASHES down from above. Dust rises.

                                     INDY
                         Ohhh!

               Indy's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of 
               sunlight leaks in through the cracks between the boards.

               Then Indy sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly 
               to its feet... an AFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar 
               walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust swirls up into the shafts of 
               sunlight.

               And Indy has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes 
               has been dislodged from his belt during the fall...

               Indy glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging 
               on a nail. He carefully takes it down by the handle. The 
               Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.

               Indy swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels 
               awkwardly, its TIP flying back and HITTING Indy IN THE FACE... 
               CUTTING his chin.

               The Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, 
               wets his lips, and tries again. This time -- success! The 
               WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion BELLOWS and SWATS the air... 
               and steps back.

               Indy looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. 
               The Lion backs away even more. Indy inches forward -- bends 
               down (never taking his eyes off the Lion) -- picks up the 
               Cross -- and steps back again, sweat pouring down his face.

               But now... how to get out?

               He looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees 
               Fedora LOOKING DOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.

                                     FEDORA
                         Toss up the whip.

               EXT. THE ROOFTOP OF STOCKCAR

               Fedora, assisted by Halfbreed and Rough Rider, "reels" Indy 
               out of the Stockcar as the Lion ROARS and lunges and Indy 
               screams.

               The men, including Roscoe, pull Indy through the hole in the 
               roof. He stands to face them as Rough Rider points a gun in 
               his direction.

                                     FEDORA
                         You've got heart, kid.
                              (indicates Cross)
                         But that belongs to me.

                                     INDY
                              (takes Cross from his 
                              belt)
                         It belongs to Coronado.

                                     FEDORA
                              (overlapping)
                         Coronado is dead. And so are all his 
                         grandchildren.

                                     INDY
                         This should be in a museum.

                                     ROSCOE
                         Now give me that!

               Roscoe makes a grab for the Cross -- but Indy doesn't let 
               go. A tug-of-war ensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S 
               SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS AROUND Roscoe's hand.

               Roscoe SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER -- releases his grip on the 
               Cross and tries to shake off the snake. This is all the 
               opportunity Indy needs. He LEAPS ONTO THE NEXT CAR.

                                     FEDORA
                         Don't let him get away!

               Indy swings down to the caboose. He sees a sign above the 
               caboose door reading "DR. FANTASY'S MAGIC CABOOSE."

                                     INDY
                         Magic?

               He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the 
               caboose, stepping inside.

               Fedora puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to 
               follow Indy.

                                     FEDORA
                         Hold it. Make sure he doesn't double 
                         back.

               INT. THE CABOOSE - DAY

               Which contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. Indy rushes to 
               the rear door of the caboose but can't open it. He hears 
               Fedora coming, and dives into a MAGIC BOX.

                                     FEDORA
                         Okay, kid. Out of the box. Now.

               Fedora smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The 
               box unexpectedly collapses; all four sides flop away... 
               revealing NOTHING. Indy has completely vanished.

               Fedora is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a 
               breeze at his back. He turns and discovers that the caboose 
               door is open. He rushes out onto the balcony and sees:

               Indy RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest 
               clapboard houses.

                                     FEDORA
                         Damn.

               EXT. STREET - SMALL TOWN - DAY

               As Indy runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his 
               house we see the name "JONES" painted on the mailbox.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

               INT. THE HOUSE - DAY

               Indy bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his 
               hand. A Husky BARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

               INT. THE STUDY - DAY

               Indy charges in. The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, 
               charts and maps clearly reflect the father's passion for 
               Medieval studies.

               PROFESSOR Henry JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he 
               is studying a very ancient parchment volume which lies open 
               on the desk. The page shows a beautifully illuminated picture 
               of what might be a stained-glass window. The sketch 
               incorporates a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is 
               not just studying it, he is copying it into his own notebook.

               We never get to see the Professor's face in this scene. So 
               Indy CHARGES IN.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

                                     HENRY
                         Out!

                                     INDY
                         It's important!

                                     HENRY
                         Then wait -- count to twenty.

                                     INDY
                         No, Dad. You listen to me --

                                     HENRY
                              (now he shouts)
                         Junior!

               No question who is the boss here. Indy gulps, his look says 
               "What am I going to do with this guy?" And obeys -- starts 
               counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY.

                                     INDY
                         One, two, three, four...

               Now we see what Henry is concentrating on. We see his hand 
               sketching; then, he holds up one finger.

                                     HENRY
                         In Greek.

               Indy's reaction:

                                     INDY
                              (louder, in Greek)
                         One... two... three... four...

               An ancient car is heard arriving. Perhaps Indy glimpses it 
               going past the window. Anyway, it stops outside the house. 
               Two men sit in the front seat. Herman sits in the rear, 
               BLOWING A TRUMPET.

               Indy's reaction: Trouble!

               Henry is just finishing the sketch.

                                     HENRY
                         May he who illuminated this... 
                         illuminate me...

               INT. THE FRONT ROOM - DAY

               The study door is just closing, Indy closing it behind him... 
               just as Herman comes through the front door, still playing 
               the trumpet.

               Indy reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from Herman's mouth. 
               Herman continues to spit -- right into Indy's face. Indy 
               flinches.

                                     HERMAN
                         I brought the Sheriff.

               Herman means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house.

                                     INDY
                         Just the man I want to see! Now, 
                         there were five or six of them.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (interrupting)
                         All right, son.

                                     INDY
                              (overlapping)
                         ...they came after... me...

                                     SHERIFF
                         You still got it?

                                     INDY
                         Well, yes, sir. It's right here!

               Indy shows the Cross, more or less handing it to the Sheriff 
               to make his point. The Sheriff takes it casually.

                                     SHERIFF
                         I'm glad to see that... because the 
                         rightful owner of this Cross won't 
                         press charges, if you give it back.

               Fedora enters the house, followed by Roscoe, Rough Rider and 
               Halfbreed. He politely removes his hat and holds it in his 
               hand. He nods at Indy in a friendly manner.

                                     SHERIFF
                         He's got witnesses, five or six of 
                         them.

               The Sheriff and Fedora are in Cahoots

               The Sheriff hands the Cross to Fedora. Roscoe reaches in and 
               takes it from Fedora, then runs out the door.

                                     ROSCOE
                         Yahoo!

               As Roscoe runs outside Indy sees -- through the screen door -- 
               the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT waiting patiently beside the car 
               that is parked out front. Roscoe approaches and gives the 
               Man the Cross -- the Man hands Roscoe some money in exchange.

               The Sheriff tips his hat and leaves.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Good day.

               Fedora remains behind for a moment. He turns and speaks to 
               Indy in an ironic man-to-man way.

                                     FEDORA
                         You lost today, kid, but that doesn't 
                         mean you have to like it.

               Then, Fedora takes off his hat and takes a step towards Indy. 
               He holds the hat by the crown, and puts it on Indy's head, a 
               show of respect and admiration for the boy. The hat blocks 
               Indy's face.

               CLOSE ON THE TOP OF THE FEDORA HAT

               The hat brim fills the screen. As the brim tilts up, WE SEE 
               the face of FULL GROWN INDIANA JONES.

               And... POW!... he's punched in the face while his arms are 
               pinned behind his back.

               FADE IN TITLE: "PORTUGUESE COAST - 1938"

                                     PANAMA HAT
                         Small world, Doctor Jones.

                                     INDY
                         Too small for two of us.

               THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT (years older now) removes the CROSS 
               OF CORONADO from Indy's belt.

                                     PANAMA HAT
                         This is the second time I've had to 
                         reclaim my property from you --

                                     INDY
                         That belongs in a museum --

                                     PANAMA HAT
                         So do you.
                              (he moves his eyeline)
                         Throw him over the side.

               THE DECK OF A PORTUGUESE CARGO SHIP

               It's NIGHT. RAIN POURS down. We're in the middle of a violent 
               STORM AT SEA. Thirty-foot waves crash across the deck.

               The TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind 
               his back) propel Indy across the deck toward the rail.

               As they pass a BUNDLE OF FUEL DRUMS, Indy uses the Two Sailors 
               as leverage to KICK UP HIS FEET and break open the CLAMP on 
               the metal bands that hold the drums together.

               Indy jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled Sailors 
               and rushes toward the Man In The Panama Hat.

               Panama Hat sees Indy coming and hurries toward the ladder 
               that leads up to the bridge. Indy withstands the force of 
               waves crashing on the deck and makes his way to where Panama 
               Hat is climbing the ladder. He pulls him off the ladder from 
               behind the two men fall down on the deck. Indy takes the 
               cross back from Panama Hat.

               A sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending 
               the cross flying out of his grip and skittering across the 
               deck. Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two sailors who 
               attack him from the sides.

               Indy sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He 
               lunges for it.

               He SNATCHES UP the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck 
               by a giant wave. He struggles to his feet, managing to avoid 
               the giant fuel drums sliding across the deck around him.

               SEVERAL MORE DRUMS come Indy's way. He sidesteps them all.

                                     PANAMA HAT
                         Grab him, he's getting away! Grab 
                         him!

               Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. 
               Indy sees a large Stevedore's hook above him and he climbs 
               up on crates to reach it. He grabs a hold of the hook and 
               uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly 
               avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking 
               ocean, still holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant 
               fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly onto a crate of 
               TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, 
               sending an enormous orange fireball into the sky.

               LONG SHOT - THE BOAT EXPLODING OUT OF THE WATER

               As bits of debris fall from the sky like rain.

               Indy BOBS UP in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross 
               in his hand. He grabs for something to keep him afloat. It 
               turns out to be one of the ship's LIFE PRESERVERS. Indy loops 
               his arm through the preserver.

               Only now do we see the FADED LETTERING on the preserver 
               revealing the destroyed ship's name and city of port: "VAZQUEZ 
               de CORONADO BARCELONA"

               A SHREDDED PANAMA HAT floats past.

               EXT. COLLEGE - DAY

               Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths.

                                     INDY (V.O.)
                         Archaeology is...

               INT. COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INDY

               Dressed in professorial tweeds, stands before his class. He 
               turns to the blackboard with a piece of chalk and writes the 
               word: "FACT."

                                     INDY
                         ...the search for fact. Not truth. 
                         If it's truth you're interested in, 
                         Doctor Tyree's Philosophy class is 
                         right down the hall.

               Laughter.

               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

                                     INDY
                         So forget any ideas you've got about 
                         lost cities, exotic travel, and 
                         digging up the world. You do not 
                         follow maps to buried treasure and 
                         "X" never, ever, marks the spot.

               MARCUS BRODY approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through 
               the window in the door to see Indy completing his lecture.

                                     INDY
                         Seventy percent of all archaeology 
                         is done in the library. Research. 
                         Reading.

               INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

               Brody enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the 
               room.

                                     INDY
                         We cannot afford to take mythology 
                         at face value.

               The BELL RINGS. Indy stands at his desk as students begin to 
               disperse. A pretty coed puts a note on the desk.

                                     INDY
                         Next week: "Egyptology." Starting 
                         with the excavation of Naukratis by 
                         Blinders Petrie in 1885. I will be 
                         in my office if anybody's got any 
                         problems for the next hour and a 
                         half.

               Brody approaches as the last of the students leaves the 
               lecture hall.

                                     INDY
                         Marcus!
                              (slaps his pocket)
                         I did it!

                                     BRODY
                         You've got it!

               Indy removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places 
               it on the desk and takes off his glasses as Brody examines 
               the Cross.

                                     INDY
                         You know how long I've been looking 
                         for that?!

                                     BRODY
                         All your life.

                                     INDY
                         All my life!

                                     BRODY
                         Well done, Indy. Very well done, 
                         indeed. This will find a place of 
                         honor in our Spanish collection.

               Indy gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door.

                                     INDY
                         We can discuss my honorarium over 
                         dinner and champagne tonight.

               He turns back toward Brody, now holding the Cross.

                                     INDY
                         Your treat.

                                     BRODY
                         Yes. My treat.

               INT. INDY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

               Bursting with STUDENTS, all competing for his attention at 
               once: "Professor Jones!" "Doctor Jones!" etc., etc.

                                     INDY
                         Shush! Shush! Shush!

               Indy shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary, an 
               overwhelmed Teaching Assistant named IRENE.

                                     IRENE
                         Doctor Jones! I'm so glad you're 
                         back! Your mail is on your desk. 
                         Here are your phone messages.

                                     MALE STUDENT
                         Doctor Jones, you promised... Doctor 
                         Jones --

                                     IRENE
                         This is your appointment schedule. 
                         And these term papers still haven't 
                         been graded.

               Indy takes the term papers then turns to enter his PRIVATE 
               OFFICE. Students once again CLAMOR for his attention: "Doctor 
               Jones!" "Wait, Doctor Jones!" "My grade!" "Sign my 
               registration card!"

               Indy silences the mob with a raised hand.

                                     INDY
                              (very efficiently)
                         Okay. Irene, put everyone's name on 
                         a list, in the order they arrived, 
                         and I'll see each and every one of 
                         them in turn.

               The Students descend upon poor Irene, each claiming to be 
               first. Indy slips into his --

               PRIVATE OFFICE

               Where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a 
               foreign postmark on it.

                                     INDY
                              (softly; reading)
                         "Venice, Italy."

               Then, Indy stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to 
               the WINDOW, slides it open and STEPS OUT INTO THE GARDEN.

               EXT. SIDE OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

               Indy escapes through the garden.

               EXT. FRONT OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

               Indy walks briskly toward the street; smiling, enjoying his 
               freedom. As he arrives at the curb, a LONG BLACK PACKARD 
               SEDAN pulls up before him.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Doctor Jones!

               THREE MEN step out of the sedan. Everything about them 
               bespeaks "G-MAN." The First Man steps behind Indy.

                                     MAN
                         Doctor Jones?

               INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY

               Indy is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left 
               alone. Numerous museum-quality artifacts are displayed around 
               the room. Indy takes this opportunity to examine them.

               After a moment, WALTER DONOVAN enters from across the room. 
               During the brief time that the door is open, we HEAR a 
               COCKTAIL PARTY going on in the next room: VOICES and SOFT 
               PIANO MUSIC.

               Donovan strides across the room toward Indy. Although in his 
               late fifties, Donovan has the broad shoulders and trim 
               physique of a much younger man. Dressed in a tuxedo, he exudes 
               both confidence and power.

                                     DONOVAN
                         I trust your trip down was 
                         comfortable, Doctor Jones. My men 
                         didn't alarm you, I hope.

               He shakes hands with Indy.

                                     DONOVAN
                         My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.

                                     INDY
                         I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your 
                         contributions to the museum over the 
                         years have been extremely generous. 
                         Some of the pieces in your collection 
                         here are very impressive.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I 
                         have a passion for antiquities.
                              (beat)
                         Have a look over here. This might 
                         interest you.

               Donovan goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth. 
               He throws back the cloth revealing a flat STONE TABLET -- 
               about two feet square, inscribed with letters and symbols.

               Indy looks impressed. He puts on his glasses to make a closer 
               examination.

                                     INDY
                         Well, it's sandstone. Christian 
                         symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth 
                         Century, I should think.

                                     DONOVAN
                         That was our assessment as well.

                                     INDY
                         Where did this come from?

                                     DONOVAN
                         My engineers unearthed it in the 
                         mountain region north of Ankara while 
                         excavating for copper.
                              (beat)
                         Can you translate the inscription?

               Translating the inscription is no easy matter, even for 
               someone as knowledgeable as Indy.

                                     INDY
                              (stumbling through it)
                         "...who drinks the water I shall 
                         give him, says the Lord, will have a 
                         spring inside him welling up for 
                         eternal life. Let them bring me to 
                         your holy mountain in the place where 
                         you dwell.

               Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy 
               reads.

                                     INDY

                         Moon, to the Temple where the cup 
                         that --"

               Suddenly Indy stops and looks up at Donovan with a startled 
               expression.

                                     INDY
                         "Where the cup that holds the blood 
                         of Jesus Christ resides forever."

                                     DONOVAN
                              (reverently)
                         The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The 
                         chalice used by Christ during the 
                         Last Supper. The cup that caught His 
                         blood at the Crucifixion and was 
                         entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.

               Indy rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the 
               glass of champagne Donovan now offers him.

                                     INDY
                         The Arthur Legend. I've heard this 
                         bedtime story before.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift 
                         of youth to whoever drinks from the 
                         Grail.
                              (beat)
                         Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd 
                         like to wake up to!

                                     INDY
                         An old man's dream.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Every man's dream.
                              (beat)
                         Including your father's, I believe.

               Indy stiffens slightly at the mention of his father, nods.

                                     INDY
                         Grail lore is his hobby. He's a 
                         teacher of Medieval Literature. The 
                         one the students hope they don't 
                         get.

               The door opens and MRS. DONOVAN steps into the room. She's a 
               matronly woman in an expensive evening gown.

                                     MRS. DONOVAN
                         Walter, you're neglecting our guests.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Be along in a moment, dear.

               He leans over and kisses her cheek. Mrs. Donovan sighs to 
               herself and returns to the party. Indy, meanwhile, has turned 
               his attention back to the Grail Tablet, obviously hooked by 
               its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with 
               champagne and rubs it over the Tablet. Donovan steps up next 
               to Indy.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy 
                         Grail's final resting place described 
                         in detail!

                                     INDY
                         What good is it? This Grail Tablet 
                         speaks of deserts and mountains and 
                         canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you 
                         start looking? Maybe if the Tablet 
                         were intact, you'd have something to 
                         go on. But the entire top portion is 
                         missing.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Just the same, an attempt to recover 
                         the Grail is currently underway.

               Indy has to shake his head at Donovan's apparent lack of 
               judgment.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Let me tell you another "bedtime 
                         story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail 
                         was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, 
                         it disappeared and was lost for a 
                         thousand years before it was found 
                         again by three Knights of the First 
                         Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.

                                     INDY
                         I've heard this one as well. Two of 
                         these brothers walked out of the 
                         desert one hundred and fifty years 
                         after having found the Grail and 
                         began the long journey back to France. 
                         But only one of them made it. And 
                         before dying of extreme old age, he 
                         supposedly imparted his tale to a -- 
                         to a Franciscan friar, I think.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.

               Donovan produces an ANCIENT LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME with very 
               brittle pages. Indy views the manuscript with considerable 
               interest.

                                     DONOVAN
                         This is the manuscript in which the 
                         friar chronicled the Knight's story... 
                         it doesn't reveal on location of the 
                         Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight 
                         promised that two "markers" that had 
                         been left behind would.
                              (indicates the Tablet)
                         This Tablet is one of those "markers." 
                         It proves the Knight's story is true. 
                         But as you pointed out -- it's 
                         incomplete.
                              (beat)
                         Now, the second "marker" is entombed 
                         with the Knight's dead brother. Our 
                         project leader believes that tomb to 
                         be located within the city of Venice, 
                         Italy.
                              (beat)
                         As you can now see, Doctor Jones, 
                         we're about to complete a great quest 
                         that began almost two thousand years 
                         ago. We're only one step away.

                         That's usually when the ground falls 
                         out from underneath your feet.

                                     DONOVAN
                         You could be more right than you 
                         know.

                                     INDY
                         Yes?

                                     DONOVAN
                         We've hit a snag. Our project leader 
                         has vanished. Along with all his 
                         research. Uh, we received a cable 
                         from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, 
                         who has no idea of his whereabouts 
                         or what's become of him.
                              (beat)
                         I want you to pick up the trail where 
                         he left off. Find the man and you 
                         will find the Grail.

                                     INDY
                         You've got the wrong Jones, Mister 
                         Donovan. Why don't you try my father?

                                     DONOVAN
                              (after a pause)
                         We already have. Your father is the 
                         man who's disappeared.

               EXT. A RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

               A FORD COUPE speeds down the tree-lined street.

               EXT. PROFESSOR HENRY JONES' HOUSE - DAY

               The Ford coupe pulls up in front of the house. Indy climbs 
               from the car and hurries up the walkway. Brody is a step 
               behind.

                                     BRODY
                         Your father and I have been friends 
                         since time began. I've watched you 
                         grow up, Indy. And I've watched the 
                         two of you grow apart.
                              (beat)
                         I've never seen you this concerned 
                         about him before.

               They climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar. 
               They exchange a quick look of concern as they enter.

               INT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Indy approaches the half-open front door.

                                     INDY
                         Dad?
                              (to Brody)
                         He's an academic A bookworm. He's 
                         not a field man.

               He pushes open the door. He enters the house and calls out.

                                     INDY
                         Dad? Dad?

               Indy opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from 
               the sitting room.

               We see the place has been ransacked.

               Brody sees Indy's face and opens the other half.

                                     BRODY
                         Dear God.

               They walk into the room.

                                     BRODY
                         What has the old fool got himself 
                         into now?

                                     INDY
                         I don't know. But whatever it is, 
                         he's in over his head!

               Brody picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk.

                                     INDY
                         Dad?

                                     BRODY
                         It's today's mail. And it's been 
                         opened.

               Indy turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes. 
               Then something hits him.

                                     INDY
                         Mail! That's it, Marcus!

               He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken 
               earlier in the day from his college office and finds the 
               envelope with the Venice postmark.

                                     INDY
                              (as he tears it open)
                         Venice, Italy!

                                     BRODY
                         What is it?

               Indy uncovers a small book. It looks like a JOURNAL or DIARY. 
               Indy flips through it: Page after page of handwritten notes 
               and drawings. Brody glances at it with great curiosity.

                                     INDY
                         It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue 
                         he ever followed. Every discovery he 
                         made. A complete record of his search 
                         for the Holy Grail. This is his whole 
                         life. Why would he have sent this to 
                         me?

                                     BRODY
                         I don't know. But someone must want 
                         it pretty badly.

                                     INDY
                         Do you believe, Marcus?

               As Indy asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the 
               wall: A depiction of Christ on the Cross, his blood being 
               captured in a golden chalice.

               A SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders 
               plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, 
               however, floats safely in midair because he holds the Grail 
               in his hands.

                                     INDY
                         Do you believe the Grail actually 
                         exists?

                                     BRODY
                         The search for the Cup of Christ is 
                         the search for the divine in all of 
                         us.

               Brody sees that Indy is unsatisfied by this response.

                                     BRODY
                         But if you want facts, Indy, I have 
                         none to give you. At my age, I'm 
                         prepared to take a few things on 
                         faith.

                                     INDY
                         Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll 
                         take that ticket to Venice now.

                                     BRODY
                         I'll tell him we'll take two.

               EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

               A LIMO is parked beside a PRIVATE AIRLINER that bears the 
               DONOVAN CORPORATE LOGO. Brody peers inside to Donovan and 
               Indy.

                                     BRODY
                         Tell me, what's going to happen when 
                         we get to Venice?

                                     DONOVAN
                              (overlapping)
                         Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will 
                         be there to meet you.

                                     BRODY
                              (overlapping)
                         Schneider?

                                     DONOVAN
                              (overlapping)
                         I maintain an apartment in Venice, 
                         at your disposal.

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.

               Brody and Donovan shake hands. Indy steps from the back seat 
               of the limo. He turns back to Donovan and shakes his hand.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Doctor Jones. Good luck. Be very 
                         careful. Don't trust anybody.

               INT. AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY

               Indy opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through 
               the pages. He stops at one page and glances at a PENCIL SKETCH 
               of what might be a stained-glass window. Below the sketch is 
               a SERIES OF NUMBERS.

               EXT. THE PRIVATE AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY

               SUPERIMPOSED over a MAP that traces a course from New York 
               City to Venice, Italy.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. VENICE - BOAT LANDING - DAY

               Indy and Brody disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat 
               Landing as other Gondoliers steer their boats in the water.

                                     INDY
                         Ah, Venice...

                                     BRODY
                         Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this 
                         Doctor Schneider when we see him?

                                     INDY
                         I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

               Suddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde 
               hair. Eyes that are bright and intelligent.

                                     ELSA
                         Doctor Jones?

                                     INDY
                         Yes?

                                     ELSA
                         I knew it was you --

               She looks at him with an appraising expression that is 
               brazenly flirtatious.

                                     ELSA
                         You have your father's eyes.

               Indy is instantly attracted to her.

                                     INDY
                         And my mother's ears. But the rest 
                         belongs to you.

                                     ELSA
                         Looks like the best parts have already 
                         been spoken for.

               Indy grins, enjoying the repartee. The Woman turns to Brody, 
               who tips his hat.

                                     ELSA
                         Marcus Brody?

                                     BRODY
                         That's right.

               The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to Brody.

                                     ELSA
                              (introducing herself)
                         Doctor Elsa Schneider.

               Indy's grin fades. Brody registers a look of surprise.

                                     BRODY
                         Uh... how do you do?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

               Indy, Brody and Elsa walk along the narrow canal, lined with 
               buildings on either side.

                                     ELSA
                         The last time I saw your father we 
                         were in the library. He was very 
                         close to tracking down the Knight's 
                         Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. 
                         He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

                                     INDY
                         Who? Attila the Professor? He was 
                         never giddy, even when he was a 
                         schoolboy!

               Indy can't take his eyes off Elsa. Perhaps he's feeling a 
               bit like a schoolboy himself right now. As they cross over a 
               bridge to the opposite side of the canal, Indy steals a flower 
               from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa.

                                     INDY
                         Fraulein -- will you permit me?

                                     ELSA
                         I usually don't.

                                     INDY
                         I usually don't either.

                                     ELSA
                         In that case, I permit you.

               Indy gives her the flower.

                                     INDY
                         It would make me very happy.

                                     ELSA
                         But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow 
                         it will have faded.

                                     INDY
                         Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

                                     BRODY
                              (cutting in)
                         I hate to interrupt you -- but the 
                         reason we're here --

                                     ELSA
                              (interrupting)
                         Yes. I have something to show you.

               She hands a slip of paper to Indy.

                                     ELSA
                         I left your father working in the 
                         library. He sent me to the map section 
                         to fetch an ancient plan of the city. 
                         When I got back to his table -- he'd 
                         gone -- with all his papers -- except 
                         for that scrap which I found near 
                         his chair.

               Indy extends the scrap of paper to Brody.

                                     INDY
                         Roman numerals.

               EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - DAY

               Elsa leads Indy and Brody into the large piazza. People walk 
               about and sit at tables in front of a large building.

                                     ELSA
                         Here is the library.

               They have arrived at the front steps of the library.

                                     INDY
                         That doesn't look much like a library.

                                     BRODY
                         It looks like a converted church.

               Elsa leads the way inside.

               INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

               Indy, Brody and Elsa enter, their heels CLICKING across the 
               marble floor.

               We notice, along with Indy and Brody, that the library 
               contains many stained-glass windows.

                                     ELSA
                         In this case it's the literal truth. 
                         We're on holy ground. These columns 
                         over here...

               She indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to 
               ceiling.

                                     ELSA
                         ...were brought back as spoils of 
                         war after the sacking of Byzantium 
                         during the Crusades.

               Indy glances at the Columns, then notices a stained-glass 
               Window that depicts a Knight of the Crusades. Indy lingers 
               for a moment in front of the window.

                                     ELSA
                         Now please excuse me. The library's 
                         closing in a few moments. I'll arrange 
                         for us to stay a little longer.

               The minute Elsa is out of earshot.

                                     INDY
                         Marcus -- I've seen this window 
                         before.

                                     BRODY
                         Where?

               Indy whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he 
               noticed in the airplane.

                                     INDY
                         Right here. In Dad's Diary. You see?

               Brody glances at the Diary, then at the window -- noticing 
               that the Roman numerals in question have been worked into 
               the window's design.

                                     BRODY
                         Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!

                                     INDY
                         Dad was onto something here!

                                     BRODY
                         Well, now we know the source of the 
                         numbers, but we still don't know 
                         what they mean.

               Indy and Brody now see Elsa approaching. Indy quickly tucks 
               the Diary back into his pocket.

                                     INDY
                              (explaining to Brody)
                         My dad sent me this Diary for a 
                         reason. Until we find out why, I 
                         suggest we keep it to ourselves.

                                     ELSA
                         Find something?

               Indy doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. 
               His eyes moving across the walls and ceilings -- charged 
               with the thrill of discovery.

                                     BRODY
                              (to Elsa)
                         Uh, yes. Three, seven and ten. That 
                         window seems to be the source of the 
                         Roman numerals.

                                     ELSA
                         My God, I must be blind

                                     INDY
                         Dad wasn't looking for a book about 
                         the Knight's Tomb... he was looking 
                         for the Tomb itself

               Elsa wears a blank expression.

                                     INDY
                         Don't you get it? The Tomb is 
                         somewhere in the library! You said 
                         yourself it used to be a church! 
                         Look.

               Indy's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.

                                     INDY
                         Three.

               Indy looks again to the stained-glass window. He points.

                                     INDY
                         Three!

               Indy has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman 
               Numeral. Indy hurries away toward Column VII. All Brody and 
               Elsa can do now is try to keep up with him.

                                     INDY
                         Seven.

               He points again to the stained-glass window.

                                     INDY
                         Seven... Ten.

               He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.

                                     INDY
                         And ten. Now where's the ten? Look 
                         around for the ten.

               Indy walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, 
               then looks down.

                                     INDY
                         Three, seven and ten.

               He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks 
               down at Brody and Elsa. The floor beneath their feet is an 
               elaborate tile design containing a huge "X" -- visible only 
               from this higher angle.

                                     INDY
                         Ten.
                              (wryly; to himself)
                         "X" marks the spot.

               Indy rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE 
               where the two sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away 
               from the tile and tries to pry it up, but cannot.

               Indy rushes past Brody to a cordon held in place by a brass 
               stand underneath the stained-glass window.

               Indy raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the 
               tile precisely as the Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian 
               regards the stamper curiously.

               Indy continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes 
               his stamping, still puzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the 
               library.

               Finally Indy breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces 
               of broken tile, a TWO-FOOT SQUARE HOLE IS REVEALED.

               Cold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole.

                                     INDY
                         Bingo.

                                     ELSA
                         You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. 
                         You're a great deal like your father.

                                     INDY
                         Except he's lost, and I'm not.

                                     ELSA
                         Lower me down.

               Indy is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeably -- 
               holding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole. 
               When her feet finally touch ground below, Indy releases his 
               grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to Brody.

                                     INDY
                         Look after this for me, will you?

               Then Indy disappears into the hole.

               INT. CATACOMBS BELOW LIBRARY - DAY

               Indy jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help Elsa.

                                     INDY
                         Come on.

               Indy and Elsa glance around. This is really a horrid place. 
               Dark and dank. Foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a 
               cigarette lighter with a unique ivory four-leaf clover design.

               Indy and Elsa inspect markings carved onto the walls.

                                     ELSA
                         Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth 
                         Century.

                                     INDY
                         Right. Six hundred years before the 
                         Crusades.

                                     ELSA
                         The Christians would have dug their 
                         own passages and burial chambers 
                         centuries later.

               Indy takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a 
               dark passageway.

                                     INDY
                         That's right. If there's a Knight of 
                         the First Crusade entombed down here, 
                         that's where we'll find him.

               INT. LIBRARY - DAY

               THREE MEN carrying guns make their way down the spiral 
               staircase toward an unsuspecting Brody. One of the Men, KAZIM, 
               raises his gun and brings it down hard on Brody's head.

                                     BRODY
                         Ohhhh...

               Kazim gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious Brody. 
               The other two men take Brody's hands and drag him into one 
               of the book-lined aisles.

               INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS - DAY

               DECOMPOSING CORPSES rest in niches carved into the stone 
               walls. Grotesque skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched 
               across blackened bones.

               Indy holds the lighter up as he and Elsa inspect symbols 
               carved into the walls.

               Elsa spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't 
               recognize. As she blows away some cobwebs:

                                     ELSA
                         What's this one?

               Indy only has to give it a quick glance to know.

                                     INDY
                         The Ark of the Covenant.

                                     ELSA
                         Are you sure?

                                     INDY
                              (deadpan)
                         Pretty sure.

               Indy holds the lighter up and he and Elsa enter another dark 
               passageway.

               ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

               Indy steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone. He 
               scrapes the cobwebs away to reveal the ROMAN NUMERAL "X."

                                     INDY
                         Watch out.

               Elsa now holds the lighter as Indy rams his shoulder into 
               the wall. The wall collapses on impact and Indy falls through 
               into another room.

               ANOTHER ROOM - THE CATACOMBS

               As Indy falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks 
               surrounded by bubbling, green, slimy liquid. More skeletons 
               surround him, resting in their carved niches. Elsa holds the 
               lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall.

                                     INDY
                         Petroleum. I could sink a well down 
                         here and retire.

               Indy reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the 
               skeletons, which breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick 
               water.

               Indy uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude 
               torch, which he then dips into the oily water.

                                     INDY
                         Give me the lighter.

               ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

               Using the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, Indy 
               and Elsa come upon a NARROW PASSAGEWAY. The water is knee-
               deep and TEEMING WITH RATS. Thousands of them crawling on 
               one another's backs. SQUEALING. Squirming. Thrashing in the 
               water.

                                     INDY
                         Oh, rats...

               Elsa gasps as the rats scamper between her legs.

               Indy moves forward through the rat-infested water as Elsa 
               follows, still gasping in horror. Suddenly he slips into a 
               hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out to Elsa.

                                     INDY
                         Come on!

               She gasps once again, terrified. Indy lifts her and carries 
               Elsa as he moves forward.

               THE CATACOMBS - THE HOLE IN THE WALL

               Kazim and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and 
               shine their flashlights through to the rat-infested water.

               ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

               More rat-infested water as Elsa, now walking again, follows 
               Indy through another passageway lined with skulls and bones.

               Indy reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently 
               grabs a skeleton. A bone comes loose in his hand as rats 
               scurry about and leap at him from all directions.

               He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the 
               water to Elsa's side. He steps into the water, then reaches 
               up to help Elsa do the same.

                                     INDY
                         Come here.

               LARGE BURIAL CHAMBER

               The chamber is flooded with black, briny water.

                                     INDY
                         Look...

               In the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is 
               what amounts to an "island altar" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT 
               COFFINS rest. They move toward the altar.

               Indy and Elsa begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS 
               like the scholars of antiquity that they are. These are big 
               oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass.

                                     INDY
                         It must be one of these...

                                     ELSA
                         Look at the artistry of these carvings 
                         and the scrollwork.

               One coffin is elevated above the others.

                                     ELSA
                         It's this one.

               Together they begin to push on the lid -- STRAINING and 
               GROANING until it slides away and BANGS against the stone 
               platform.

               INSIDE THE COFFIN

               Lie the DECOMPOSED REMAINS of a KNIGHT IN ARMOR. Indy and 
               Elsa look in... Elsa gasps.

                                     INDY
                         This is it! We found it! Look -- the 
                         engraving on the shield. It's the 
                         same as on the Grail Tablets. The 
                         shield is the second marker!

               Indy unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield.

                                     ELSA
                         What's that?

                                     INDY
                         It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail 
                         Tablet.

               The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.

                                     ELSA
                         Just like your father -- giddy as a 
                         schoolboy.

               Indy laughs.

                                     ELSA
                         Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were 
                         here now to see this?

                                     INDY
                              (chuckles)
                         He never would have made it past the 
                         rats! He hates rats! He's scared to 
                         death of them!

               CLOSE - A HAND

               As it lights a match.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL KAZIM

               Dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick water.

               INDY AND ELSA

               Elsa holds the torch. Indy looks around. Listens. Something 
               is wrong. And then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing 
               across the Catacomb walls.

               This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around 
               the corner of the Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward Elsa 
               and Indy -- SHRIEKING and SQUEALING as they approach.

               The rats literally wash over them -- like a rodent tidal 
               wave -- in their efforts to escape a:

               HUGE ORANGE BALL OF FIRE

               ROARING around the corner hurtling towards them -- feeding 
               on the oil slick; consuming the oxygen.

               Elsa SCREAMS.

                                     INDY
                         Get back! Back against the wall.

               Indy braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN 
               with his feet. It CRASHES against the stone platform and 
               SPLASHES into the water.

                                     INDY
                         Quick! Under it!

               They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned 
               coffin.

                                     INDY
                         Air pocket!

               Elsa hesitates. Indy literally DUNKS her and pushes her 
               underneath.

               UNDER THE COFFIN

               Elsa surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, 
               SPUTTERING and SPITTING.

               Now Indy pops up into the air pocket. He looks at Elsa -- 
               they are both soaking wet.

                                     INDY
                         Don't wander off.

                                     ELSA
                         What?

               Indy disappears under the water and swims out from under the 
               coffin.

                                     ELSA
                         What?

               UNDER THE WATER

               Indy swims, looking for an escape route.

               UNDER THE COFFIN

               The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming 
               through the water and climbing on Elsa, who squirms and 
               screams in terror.

               Indy pops back up through the water.

                                     INDY
                         I think I've found a way out. Deep 
                         breath.

               Elsa groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the 
               water.

               EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

               The perfect picture postcard -- St. Mark's Square and the 
               Grand Canal beyond. Cafe customers are startled to see Indy 
               and Elsa climb out of the sewer, wet and smelly. Indy looks 
               around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles.

                                     INDY
                              (wryly)
                         Ah, Venice!

               Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since Kazim and TWO 
               OTHER TURKISH AGENTS are running towards them with drawn 
               guns.

               He grabs Elsa by the hand and the two of them run down the 
               dock and LEAP INTO A MOTORBOAT.

               INT. THE MOTORBOAT - DAY

               Indy fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but 
               not before a TURKISH AGENT JUMPS in with him.

               Elsa grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while Indy 
               and the Turk trade punches.

               EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY

               Indy's Speedboat BOUNCES across the choppy waters heading in 
               the direction of the DOCKED STEAMSHIP.

               Kazim and his men rush to TWO MORE SPEEDBOATS tied to the 
               dock.

               They chase after Indy.

               Indy grapples with the Turkish Agent. As Indy grips his arms, 
               we SEE a GUN in the Agent's hand. It FIRES.

               As Indy fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the 
               Speedboats behind him and two enormous Freighters ahead of 
               him, joined together by two giant ropes.

               Indy, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish 
               Agent.

                                     INDY
                              (to Elsa)
                         Are you crazy?! You don't go between 
                         them!

               Elsa can barely hear Indy over the noise of the motor.

                                     ELSA
                         Go between them? Are you crazy?!

               Indy finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent 
               flying overboard. Turning, Indy sees that Elsa has committed 
               the speedboat to a course BETWEEN the two Freighters, now 
               being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.

                                     INDY
                         I said go around!

                                     ELSA
                         You said go between them!

                                     INDY
                         I said don't go between them!

               It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the 
               two Freighters loom up on either side of them like cavern 
               walls.

               EXT. FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR - DAY

               One Enemy Speedboat chases Indy between the two Freighters. 
               But the Speedboat containing Kazim veers off and goes around.

               EXT. BETWEEN THE TWO FREIGHTERS - DAY

               It's a race for daylight as the two Freighters drift ever 
               closer to one another.

               Indy's Speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. 
               But the Enemy Speedboat EXPLODES as it is crushed between 
               the two Freighters, FLYING INTO THE AIR and SPLASHING back 
               down into the water.

               INDY AND ELSA

               Spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S 
               SPEEDBOAT appear racing toward them. He stands in the moving 
               boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at Indy and Elsa.

               KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT

               Matches Indy's move for move.

               FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR

               The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A 
               CHATTERING MACHINE GUN from Kazim's boat SPLINTERS the wood 
               of Indy's boat, until finally the rear of the boat CATCHES 
               ON FIRE.

               The machine gun runs out of ammunition. Kazim puts it down 
               and takes control of the wheel from one of the Turkish Agents 
               in the boat with him.

               As Indy's boat drifts toward the GIANT, TURNING PROPELLERS 
               at the STERN of ANOTHER STEAMER, Kazim's boat draws up 
               alongside and hits them. Indy steps into Kazim's boat. He 
               knocks one of the Turkish Agents to the deck, then turns his 
               attention to Kazim. The two men trade punches as the boat 
               spins helplessly in the churning water.

                                     ELSA
                         No!!

               Indy kicks Kazim in the face, knocking him into the water, 
               then pulls him back into the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH 
               THE CHURNING WATER toward the Steamer's giant propeller 
               blades.

                                     INDY
                         Why are you trying to kill us?

                                     KAZIM
                         Because you're looking for the Holy 
                         Grail.

                                     INDY
                         My father was looking for the Holy 
                         Grail. Did you kill him too?

                                     KAZIM
                         No.

                                     INDY
                         Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. 
                         Damn it, tell me! Tell me!

                                     KAZIM
                         If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, 
                         we'll both die.

                                     INDY
                         Then we'll die.

                                     KAZIM
                         My soul is prepared. How's yours?

               By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and 
               the blades are getting closer.

                                     INDY
                         This is your last chance.

                                     KAZIM
                         No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!

               The wind of the blades is on their necks. Indy grabs Kazim 
               just in time and jumps... into the motorboat, driven by Elsa, 
               which gets alongside in the nick of time.

                                     INDY
                         All right! Where's my father

                                     KAZIM
                         If you let me go, I will tell you 
                         where he is.

                                     INDY
                         Who are you?

                                     KAZIM
                         My name is Kazim.

                                     INDY
                         And why were you trying to kill me?

                                     KAZIM
                         The secret of the Grail has been 
                         safe for a thousand years. And for 
                         all that time the Brotherhood of the 
                         Cruciform Sword has been prepared to 
                         do anything to keep it safe.

               Kazim pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it 
               a tattoo? Whatever it is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian 
               cross which tapers down, like the blades of a broadsword.

                                     KAZIM
                         Let me get off at this jetty.

               The boat is close to the edge of the canal. Indy gives Elsa 
               a nod, telling her to bring the boat in. Kazim steps ashore.

                                     KAZIM
                         Ask yourself, why do you seek the 
                         Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, 
                         or for yours?

                                     INDY
                         I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. 
                         I came to find my father.

                                     KAZIM
                         In that case, God be with you in 
                         your quest. Your father is being 
                         held in the Castle of Brunwald on 
                         the Austrian-German border.

               Kazim walks away.

               INT. VENICE APARTMENT - DAY

               CLOSE ON THE WATER-SOAKED PAPER IMPRESSION: The rubbing taken 
               from the shield of the Grail Knight.

               Brody is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on 
               the back of his head with an ice pack.

                                     INDY
                         How's the head?

                                     BRODY
                         It's better, now I've seen this. 
                         It's the name of a city. 
                         "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...

               Indy, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression.

                                     INDY
                         The Knights of the First Crusade 
                         laid siege to the city of Alexandretta 
                         for over a year. The entire city was 
                         destroyed.

               Brody lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at Indy.

                                     INDY
                         The present city of Iskenderun is 
                         built on its ruins. Marcus -- you 
                         remember what the Grail Tablet said. 
                         "Across the desert and through the 
                         mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent 
                         Moon."
                              (pause)
                         But where exactly?

                                     BRODY
                         Your father would know. Your father 
                         did know. Look. He made a map.

               Brody picks up the Grail Diary.

                                     BRODY
                         He must have pieced it together from 
                         clues scattered through the whole 
                         history of the Grail Quest. A map 
                         with no names.

               INSERT: A PENCIL-DRAWN MAP

               It covers two pages of the Diary. Brody's finger moves across 
               it.

                                     BRODY
                         Now, he knew there was a city with 
                         an oasis due east. Here. He knew the 
                         course turned south through the desert 
                         to a river, and the river led into 
                         the mountains. Here. Straight to the 
                         canyon. He knew everything except 
                         where to begin, the name of the city.

                                     INDY
                              (solemnly)
                         Alexandretta. Now we know.

                                     BRODY
                         Yes. Now we know.

                                     INDY
                              (rising)
                         Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him 
                         to meet you in Iskenderun.

               Indy closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of 
               his robe.

                                     BRODY
                         What about you?

                                     INDY
                         I'm going after Dad.

               INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Indy opens the door. His bedroom has been ransacked... the 
               mattress on the floor, the drawers turned out.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY

               Indy approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa?

               He goes in.

               INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               ...and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked 
               state to his own. The room is empty.

               He is worried for her, knocks and calls out:

                                     INDY
                         Elsa?

               He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa?

               He opens the bathroom door, peering inside.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa?

               INT. ELSA'S BATHROOM - DAY

               Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. 
               She gasps, startled, as Indy enters. He retreats back into 
               her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a record player 
               sitting on a ledge above the bathtub.

               INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Elsa joins Indy, waiting in the ransacked room. She looks 
               around in shock.

                                     ELSA
                         My room!

                                     INDY
                         Mine, too.

                                     ELSA
                         What were they looking for?

               She looks to Indy, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket.

                                     INDY
                         This.

                                     ELSA
                         The Grail Diary.

                                     INDY
                         Uh-huh.

                                     ELSA
                         You had it? You didn't trust me!

               She looks hurt and beautiful. She comes closer to him.

                                     INDY
                         I didn't know you.

               She's awfully hard to resist.

                                     INDY
                         At least I let you tag along.

                                     ELSA
                         Oh, yes. Give them a flower and 
                         they'll follow you anywhere.

                                     INDY
                         Knock it off. You're not mad.

                                     ELSA
                         No?

                                     INDY
                         No. You like the way I do things.

                                     ELSA
                         It's lucky I don't do things the 
                         same way. You'd still be standing at 
                         the Venice pier.

               She stomps her foot angrily. Indy flinches. She starts to 
               walk away but Indy grabs her.

                                     INDY
                         Look, what do you think is going on 
                         here? Since I've met you, I've nearly 
                         been incinerated, drowned, shot at, 
                         and chopped into fish bait. We're 
                         caught in the middle of something 
                         sinister here. My guess is Dad found 
                         out more than he was looking for. 
                         And until I'm sure, I'm going to 
                         continue to do things the way I think 
                         they should be done.

               He pulls her to him and kisses her.

                                     ELSA
                         How dare you kiss me!

               Now Elsa reaches for Indy and kisses him.

                                     INDY
                         Leave me alone. I don't like fast 
                         women.

               But he embraces her, and Elsa begins to nibble at his ear.

                                     ELSA
                         And I hate arrogant men.

               Indy smiles slyly as they fall to the bed.

               EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

               A GONDOLIER SINGS as he steers his gondola carrying two 
               passengers past Indy's window.

               INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Indy lies on top of Elsa, kissing her. He stops for a moment 
               as he hears the Gondolier SINGING.

                                     INDY
                         Ahh, Venice.

               Elsa reaches up and pulls him back down to her.

               EXT. ROAD THROUGH THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

               A Mercedes-Benz glides through the sharp mountain curves. 
               This is SUPERIMPOSED OVER A MAP that charts their course 
               from Venice across Austria toward Salzburg.

               EXT. CASTLE IN THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

               Storm clouds darken the skies. THUNDER EXPLODES in the 
               distance; lightning flashes. The Mercedes-Benz drives into 
               the courtyard of the formidable stone castle.

                                     INDY
                         What do you know about this place?

                                     ELSA
                         I know the Brunwalds are famous art 
                         collectors.

               INT. MERCEDES-BENZ - DAY

               Indy reaches into the back seat and retrieves his bullwhip.

                                     ELSA
                         What are you going to do?

                                     INDY
                         Don't know. Think of something.

               He glances up to the beret Elsa is wearing. She reaches up 
               and adjusts it.

               INT. CASTLE ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

               A BUTLER walks to the door and opens it to reveal Indy and 
               Elsa standing outside in the rain. She now wears Indy's 
               fedora; Indy is wearing Elsa's beret.

                                     BUTLER
                         Yes?

               Indy, followed by Elsa, steps inside, shaking the water from 
               his overcoat. He adopts a Scottish accent.

                                     INDY
                         And not before time! Did you intend 
                         to leave us standing on the doorstep 
                         all day? We're drenched!

               As Indy says this he pushes his way past the startled Butler, 
               pulling a handkerchief from the man's pocket. Elsa follows, 
               taking off her coat. Indy SNEEZES HARD.

                                     INDY
                         Now look! I've gone and caught a 
                         sniffle.

               Indy dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as Elsa looks on 
               in amused amazement.

                                     BUTLER
                              (coldly; with Austrian 
                              accent)
                         Are you expected?

                                     INDY
                         Don't take that tone with me, my 
                         good man. Now buttle off and tell 
                         Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence 
                         MacDonald and his lovely assistant 
                         are here to view the tapestries.

                                     BUTLER
                         Tapestries?

                                     INDY
                         Dear me, the man is dense. This is a 
                         castle, isn't it? There are 
                         tapestries?

                                     BUTLER
                         This is a castle. And we have many 
                         tapestries. But if you're a Scottish 
                         lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.

                                     INDY
                         How dare he?!

               Simultaneously knocking the Butler cold with one slug on the 
               jaw. The Butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down 
               to the floor, out cold.

               INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

               Indy and Elsa move cautiously and quietly down the wide, 
               vaulted hallway. APPROACHING VOICES ARE HEARD. Indy and Elsa 
               creep past a room full of NAZI SOLDIERS working around a 
               large table with a map atop it..

               Indy reacts to the sight of them.

                                     INDY
                              (to Elsa; softly)
                         Nazis. I hate these guys.

               Indy and Elsa continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun 
               in his hand and his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a 
               closed door and listens.

                                     INDY
                         This one. I think he's in here.

                                     ELSA
                         How do you know?

               Indy points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE.

                                     INDY
                         Because it's wired.

               He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter 
               one of the other doors. He knocks at the door -- there is no 
               response. He looks back at Elsa and enters.

               INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

               The room is dark and empty. Indy throws open the window 
               shutters and looks out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is 
               a wide ledge beneath each window -- but below that is a SHEER 
               DROP. Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge, which is 
               several yards away.

                                     ELSA
                         Indy? Indy?

               Indy reassures her.

                                     INDY
                         Don't worry... this is kid's play. 
                         I'll be right back.

               He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some 
               wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next 
               window.

               He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will 
               hold his weight.

               EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

               Indy SWINGS from the window to the stone gargoyle.

               CLOSE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE

               A PAIR OF WOODEN SHUTTERS seals the window.

               Indy takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off 
               with his feet... swings toward the shuttered window with his 
               feet extended... CRASHING THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a 
               CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise.

               INT. THE ROOM - DAY

               Indy CRASHES THROUGH SHUTTERS AND GLASS into the room. The 
               broken shutters hang by their hinges. Rain and cold air whip 
               through the open window.

               No sooner does Indy get to his feet, than a VASE COMES 
               CRASHING DOWN ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

               Stunned, Indy sinks to one knee... and Indy's father, 
               PROFESSOR Henry JONES, steps out of the shadows.

                                     HENRY
                         Junior?

               Indy gets to his feet.

                                     INDY
                              (a reflex)
                         Yes, sir!

               This reply is a kneejerk reaction on Indy's part. Now they 
               look at each other.

                                     HENRY
                         It is you Junior!

                                     INDY
                              (an old familiar 
                              irritation)
                         Don't call me that, please.

                                     HENRY
                              (amazed)
                         But what are you doing here?

                                     INDY
                         I came to get you! What do you think?

               NAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. Indy and Henry press 
               themselves against the wall, Henry still holding the broken 
               vase in his hand.

               Indy steps to the window and looks down. Henry moves to a 
               lamp, holding the vase under the light for a closer look.

                                     HENRY
                              (sotto, mumbled)
                         Late Fourteenth Century, Ming Dynasty.

               Henry is all about the broken vase which he still holds in 
               his hand. Father and son get onto crossed lines for a couple 
               of moments.

                                     HENRY
                         Oh, it breaks the heart.

                                     INDY
                              (quietly to himself)
                         And the head.
                              (to Henry, aggrievedly)
                         You hit me, Dad!

                                     HENRY
                              (referring to the 
                              vase)
                         I'll never forgive myself --

                                     INDY
                              (surprised, 
                              misunderstanding)
                         Don't worry -- I'm fine.

                                     HENRY
                         Thank God!

               Henry has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase... 
               he is examining the broken end carefully.

                                     HENRY
                         ...it's fake. See, you can tell by 
                         the cross section.

               Henry throws the vase against the wall where it SHATTERS.

                                     INDY
                         No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got 
                         to get out of here.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, I am sorry about your head, 
                         though. But I thought you were one 
                         of them.

                                     INDY
                         Dad, they come in through the doors.

                                     HENRY
                              (laughs)
                         Good point.

               Indy steps to the door and stands, listening.

                                     HENRY
                         But better safe than sorry.

               Henry slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag.

                                     HENRY
                         Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. 
                         But by God, I wasn't wrong when I 
                         mailed you my Diary. You obviously 
                         got it.

                                     INDY
                         I got it and I used it. We found the 
                         entrance to the catacombs.

                                     HENRY
                              (excited)
                         Through the library?

                                     INDY
                         Right.

                                     HENRY
                         I knew it. And the tomb of Sir 
                         Richard?

               Indy nods.

                                     INDY
                         Found it.

                                     HENRY
                              (breathless)
                         He was actually there? You saw him?

                                     INDY
                         Well, what was left of him.

                                     HENRY
                              (trembling with 
                              anticipation)
                         And his shield... the inscription on 
                         Sir Richard's shield...?

                                     INDY
                         Alexandretta.
                              (beat)
                         It's a great moment in Henry's life. 
                         He turns aside, lost to himself for 
                         a moment, then turns to Indy with 
                         joy.

                                     HENRY
                         Alexandretta... of course... on the 
                         pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. 
                         Oh, Junior...

               Indy winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the 
               moment.

                                     HENRY
                         ...you did it.

                                     INDY
                         No, Dad. You did. Forty years.

                                     HENRY
                         If only I could have been with you.

                                     INDY
                         There were rats, Dad.

                                     HENRY
                         Rats?

                                     INDY
                         Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis 
                         want with you Dad?

                                     HENRY
                         They want my diary.

                                     INDY
                              (interested)
                         Yeah?

               Indy's interest is a moment which becomes important later 
               but for now it passes.

                                     HENRY
                         I knew I had to get that book as far 
                         away from me as I possibly could.

               Indy's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket. His eyes turn 
               inward.

                                     INDY
                              (thoughtfully)
                         Yeah...

               Then... BAM! The door is kicked open and three NAZIS enter. 
               One is an S.S. OFFICER. The other two are SOLDIERS with 
               machine guns. Henry and Indy raise their hands.

                                     S.S. OFFICER
                         Doctor Jones!!

                                     HENRY & INDY
                         Yes!!

                                     S.S. OFFICER
                         I will take the book now.

                                     INDY & HENRY
                              (simultaneously)
                         What book?

                                     S.S. OFFICER
                              (to Indy)
                         You have the Diary in your pocket.

               Henry laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at 
               the expense of the S.S. Officer.

                                     HENRY
                         Do you think that my son would be 
                         that stupid that he would bring my 
                         Diary all the way back here?

               At which point an awful thought strikes Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         You didn't, did you?
                              (a beat)
                         You didn't bring it, did you?

                                     INDY
                         Well, uh...

                                     HENRY
                         You did!!

                                     INDY
                         Look, can we discuss this later?

                                     HENRY
                         I should have mailed it to the Marx 
                         Brothers.

                                     INDY
                              (overlapping)
                         Will you take it easy!

                                     HENRY
                         Take it easy?! Why do you think I 
                         sent it home in the first place?
                              (points towards the 
                              Nazis)
                         So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!

                                     INDY
                         I came here to save you.

                                     HENRY
                         Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to 
                         save you, Junior??

               Indy's eyes blazes. His nostrils flares. He's so pissed off, 
               he literally RIPS A MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the 
               startled soldiers... and for a moment we think he's going to 
               use it on his dad.

                                     INDY
                         I told you --

               He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting 
               all three Nazis to ribbons and blowing them backwards across 
               the room.

                                     INDY
                         Don't call me Junior!

               Henry looks shocked and horrified.

                                     HENRY
                         Look what you did!!

               Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead.

                                     HENRY
                              (aghast)
                         I can't believe what you just...

               INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

               Indy leads Henry down the hallway as he searches for Elsa.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa? Elsa?

               He opens a door and enters:

               INT. FIRST CASTLE ROOM - DAY

               Indy and Henry rush back into the room where Elsa had been 
               left, only to find: A NAZI COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE.

               His name is Vogel: a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute. 
               One arm is wrapped around Elsa's waist, the other hand presses 
               the muzzle of a LUGER behind her ear.

                                     VOGEL
                         That's far enough Put down the gun, 
                         Doctor Jones. Put down the gun or 
                         the Fraulein dies.

                                     HENRY
                         But she's one of them!

                                     ELSA
                         Indy, please!

                                     HENRY
                         She's a Nazi!

                                     INDY
                         What?!

               Indy is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at Elsa, 
               then back to his father. Everyone is yelling at once:

                                     HENRY
                         Trust me!

                                     ELSA
                         Indy, no!

                                     VOGEL
                         I will kill her!

                                     HENRY
                         Oh yeah? Go ahead!

                                     INDY
                         No! Don't Shoot!

                                     HENRY
                              (to Indy)
                         Don't worry. He won't.

                                     ELSA
                         Indy, please! Do what he says!

                                     HENRY
                         And don't listen to her!

                                     VOGEL
                         Enough! She dies!

               Vogel jams the barrel of the Luger painfully into Elsa's 
               neck. Elsa SCREAMS.

                                     INDY
                         Wait! Wait!

               And then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table 
               and it slides across, SHATTERING GLASS. Henry GROANS audibly.

               Vogel releases his grip on Elsa and shoves her toward Indy. 
               She is propelled directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. 
               She buries her face in his chest.

                                     ELSA
                         I'm sorry.

               Indy comforts her.

                                     INDY
                         No, don't be.

               Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail 
               Diary.

                                     ELSA
                         But you should have listened to your 
                         father.

               She steps back next to Vogel. Indy is stunned. Henry gives 
               him his most withering look of reprimand.

               INT. BARONIAL ROOM - DAY

               A large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and 
               suits of armor. Firelight -- from the giant fireplace -- 
               dances across the ceiling and walls.

               Indy and Henry are ushered in, hands tied behind back, 
               accompanied by Vogel and Elsa and TWO NAZI GUARDS.

               Elsa crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the 
               fireplace. Indy and Henry do not have the advantage of seeing 
               who is sitting in that chair. They only see a HAND REACH OUT 
               AND TAKE THE BOOK.

                                     INDY
                              (quietly to Henry)
                         She ransacked her own room and I 
                         fell for it. How did you know she 
                         was a Nazi?

                                     HENRY
                         Umh?

                                     INDY
                         How did you she was a Nazi?

                                     HENRY
                         She talks in her sleep.

               Indy nods, and then the statement catches up with him. He 
               looks at Henry with surprise.

                                     HENRY
                         I didn't trust her. Why did you?

                                     MAN IN CHAIR
                         Because he didn't take my advice.

               The MAN IN THE CHAIR gets to his feet and turns, revealing 
               himself to be... Walter Donovan. Indy and Henry react with 
               stunned expressions.

                                     INDY
                         DONOVAN!

                                     DONOVAN
                         Didn't I warn you not to trust 
                         anybody, Doctor Jones?

               Donovan smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary.

                                     HENRY
                         I misjudged you Walter -- I knew 
                         you'd sell your mother for an Etruscan 
                         vase. But I didn't know you'd sell 
                         your country and your soul to the 
                         slime of humanity.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (suddenly erupting)
                         Doctor Schneider. There're pages 
                         torn out of this!

               Elsa rushes to Donovan's side. She takes the Grail Diary 
               from him. Elsa takes a look for herself -- then glances up 
               at Indy.

                                     ELSA
                         This book contained a map -- a map 
                         with no names -- precise directions 
                         from the unknown city to the secret 
                         Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

                                     INDY
                         So it did.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Where are these missing pages? This 
                         maps we must have these pages backs

               Henry gives Indy a look of surprise. Indy smirks.

                                     ELSA
                              (to Donovan)
                         You're wasting your breath. He won't 
                         tell us. And he doesn't have to... 
                         it's perfectly obvious where the 
                         pages are...
                              (looking at Indy)
                         ...he's given them to Marcus Brody.

               Henry now wears a pained expression.

                                     HENRY
                              (to Indy)
                         Marcus?! You didn't drag poor Marcus 
                         along, did you? He's not up to the 
                         challenge.

                                     DONOVAN
                         He sticks out like a sore thumb. 
                         We'll find him.

                                     INDY
                         The hell you will. He's got a two-
                         day head-start on you, which is more 
                         than he needs.
                              (beat)
                         Brody's got friends in every town 
                         and village from here to the Sudan. 
                         He speaks a dozen languages, knows 
                         every local custom. He'll blend in. 
                         Disappear. You'll never see him again. 
                         With any luck, he's got the Grail 
                         already.

               Henry looks amazed and impressed.

               EXT. TRAIN STATION - CITY OF ISKENDERUN - DAY

               Brody disembarks from the train along with the other 
               PASSENGERS, a cross-section of ARABS and TUSKS.

                                     BRODY
                         Does anyone here speak English? Or 
                         even ancient Greek?

               A Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to Brody.

                                     BRODY
                         No water, no thank you. No, fish 
                         make love in it.

               Brody continues through the crowd past various STREET VENDORS. 
               A Woman holds a chicken out to him.

                                     BRODY
                         Thank you so much. No, I don't like 
                         that. No, I really don't want... No, 
                         no, thank you very much. No, thank 
                         you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.

               The Woman walks away, leaving Brody alone in the crowd.

                                     BRODY
                         Does anyone understand a word I'm 
                         saying here?

               Sallah shoulders his way through the mob toward Brody.

                                     SALLAH
                         Mister Brody!

               They meet and hug, then begin to walk.

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, Sallah! What a relief!

                                     SALLAH
                              (laughs)
                         Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?

                                     BRODY
                              (overlapping)
                         Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.

                                     SALLAH
                         You are on your own?

               A Woman runs in and tugs on Brody's coat. He waves her away.

                                     BRODY
                         Yes, but don't panic. Everything's 
                         under control. Have you... have you 
                         arranged our supplies?

                                     SALLAH
                         Oh, yes, of course. But where are we 
                         going?

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, this map will show you. It was 
                         drawn by, uh...

               Brody searches in his coat pocket for the map as a SINISTER 
               MAN approaches.

                                     SINISTER MAN
                         Mister Brody?

               Brody puts the map back in his pocket. The Sinister Man clicks 
               his heels and bows quickly.

                                     SINISTER MAN
                         Welcome to Iskenderun. The Director 
                         of the Museum of Antiquities has 
                         sent a car for you.

               Brody takes off his hat.

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, what?... your servant, sir.

                                     SALLAH
                         And I am his.

                                     SINISTER MAN
                         Follow me, please.

               The man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. Brody and Sallah follow 
               them.

                                     BRODY
                         My reputation precedes me.

                                     SALLAH
                         There is no museum in Iskenderun.

               The Second Man overhears Sallah. He and his companion turn 
               quickly.

                                     SECOND MAN
                         Papers please.

                                     SALLAH
                         Papers?
                              (laughs)
                         Of course.

               Sallah puts Brody's luggage down and glances at Brody.

                                     SALLAH
                         Run.

               Brody does not run. Sallah pats his clothing, searching for 
               his papers.

                                     BRODY
                         Yes.

                                     SALLAH
                         Papers, sir. Got it here.

               Sallah laughs and pulls out a newspaper.

                                     SALLAH
                         Just finished reading it myself.
                              (laughs; then, to 
                              Brody)
                         Run!

               Brody looks confused. Sallah shows the newspaper to the Second 
               Man.

                                     BRODY
                         Yes.

                                     SALLAH
                         Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.
                              (to Brody)
                         Run!

                                     BRODY
                         Did you say...? Uh, uh...

               Sallah puts the newspaper in front of the Second Man's face, 
               then punches him through the newspaper.

                                     SALLAH
                         Run!

               The Second Man falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. Sallah 
               and Brody begin to run. Sallah knocks the First Man into 
               another vendor's stand. The STAND COLLAPSES on impact.

               Sallah grabs Brody and pulls him through the crowded streets.

                                     SALLAH
                              (to Brody; pointing)
                         Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick! 
                         Hide in that door! Hide in that door!

               Sallah points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at 
               the top of a ramp. Brody runs up the ramp, throws back the 
               curtain and disappears into the darkness.

               Then -- METAL DOORS ARE SLAMMED behind Brody and we realize 
               that he has actually run into the back of a Nazi TROOP TRUCK.

               Sallah runs after the Truck until he reaches a wall, then 
               leans against the wall dejectedly as the Truck drives away 
               with Brody inside.

               INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

               The room is dark. Ancient, floor-length drapes cover the 
               windows. A HUGE FIREPLACE that's nearly large enough for a 
               man to stand upright in dominates one wall.

               The Nazi Guards have tied Indy and Henry back-to-back in a 
               pair of chairs. Elsa and Donovan stand over them. Vogel 
               enters.

                                     HENRY
                         Intolerable.

                                     VOGEL
                         Doctor Schneider. Message from Berlin. 
                         You must return immediately: a rally 
                         at the Institute of Aryan Culture.

                                     ELSA
                         So?

                                     VOGEL
                         Your presence on the platform is 
                         requested... at the highest level.

                                     ELSA
                         Thank you, Herr Oberst.
                              (to Donovan)
                         I will meet you at Iskenderun.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Take this Diary to the Reich Museum 
                         in Berlin. It will show them our 
                         progress, ahead of schedule. Without 
                         a map, I'm afraid it's no better 
                         than a souvenir.

               He hands her the Grail Diary.

                                     VOGEL
                              (to Donovan, meaning 
                              Indy and Henry)
                         Let me kill them now.

                                     ELSA
                         No. If we fail to recover the pages 
                         from Brody, we'll need them alive.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (to Vogel, with a 
                              helpless shrug)
                         Always do what the doctor orders.

               Donovan leads Vogel out. The Nazi Guards follow. Once they 
               are gone, Elsa turns to Indy.

                                     ELSA
                         Don't look at me like that -- we 
                         both wanted the Grail, I would have 
                         done anything to get it. You would 
                         have done the same.

               Indy shakes his head "no."

                                     INDY
                         I'm sorry you think so.

               She runs her hand down the side of his face. Indy pulls away.

               Indy and Henry are still tied back-to-back of course. Elsa 
               bends to speak quietly into Indy's ear... which is near enough 
               to Henry's ear.

                                     ELSA
                              (whispers)
                         I can't forget... how wonderful it 
                         was.

                                     HENRY
                         Thank you. It was rather wonderful.

               She smiles and kisses Indy passionately. Henry glances back 
               and looks rather disappointed.

               Vogel appears to remind Elsa of her appointment.

                                     VOGEL
                         Doctor Schneider! Your car is waiting.

                                     ELSA
                              (to Indy, after 
                              finishing the kiss)
                         That's how Austrians say goodbye.

               Elsa exits. Vogel stays behind for another moment.

                                     VOGEL
                         And this is how we say goodbye in 
                         Germany, Doctor Jones.

               Vogel punches Indy in the jaw. A hard and vicious jab that 
               snaps Indy's head around.

                                     HENRY
                         Ohh...

               Vogel exits. Indy shakes his head clear.

                                     INDY
                              (to himself)
                         Ooooh... I like the Austrian way 
                         better.

                                     HENRY
                         So did I.

                                     INDY
                         Let's try and get these ropes loose. 
                         We've got to get to Marcus before 
                         the Nazis do!

                                     HENRY
                              (confused)
                         You said he had two days' start. 
                         That he would blend in. Disappear!

                                     INDY
                         Are you kidding? -- I made that up! 
                         You know Marcus -- he got lost once 
                         in his own museum!

               Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.

                                     INDY
                         Can you try and reach into my left 
                         jacket pocket?

               Henry is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. 
               Indy squirms his body around towards Henry's hand.

                                     HENRY
                         What am I looking for?

                                     INDY
                         My lucky charm.

                                     HENRY
                         Feels like a cigarette lighter.

                                     INDY
                         Try and burn through the ropes.

               Henry's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.

                                     HENRY
                         Very good.

               Henry yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops 
               the lighter to the floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying 
               to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to burn. Indy doesn't 
               know it yet.

                                     HENRY
                         I ought to tell you something.

                                     INDY
                         Don't get sentimental now Dad -- 
                         save it 'til we get out of here.

                                     HENRY
                         The floor's on fire! See?!

                                     INDY
                              (turns and sees)
                         What???

                                     HENRY
                         And the chair.

                                     INDY
                         All right, move! Move! Rock your 
                         Chair. Do what I do.

               They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off 
               the burning carpet.

               EXT. CASTLE - DAY

               As Elsa is driven away. Vogel and Donovan remain behind, 
               flanked by NAZI SOLDIERS.

               Another car pulls up and Vogel holds the door open for Donovan 
               who gets into the rear seat. A LIEUTENANT approaches with a 
               written message for Donovan.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Etwas Wichtiges, mein Herr.

               Donovan puts on his glasses to read the message.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Well, we have Marcus Brody. But more 
                         important, we have the map.

               A RADIO OPERATOR steps forward with yet another written 
               message for Donovan.

                                     RADIO OPERATOR
                         Aus Berlin, mein Herr.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (reading)
                         "By the personal command of the 
                         Fuhrer. Secrecy essential to success. 
                         Eliminate the American conspirators."
                              (to Vogel)
                         Germany has declared war on the Jones 
                         boys.
                              (to DRIVER)
                         Losfahren.

               The car drives off.

               INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

               Indy and Henry are still in their chairs, tied back-to-back. 
               Indy tries to communicate with Henry, but each time he calls 
               him, the men turn their heads in opposite directions.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

               Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     INDY
                         Head for the fireplace!

                                     HENRY
                         Oh.

               BANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their 
               way INTO THE FIREPLACE -- the only safe place from the now 
               ROARING FIRE.

                                     INDY
                         I think I can get these ropes off.

               Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and 
               accidentally hits a metal grill that operates a Secret Door.

                                     INDY
                         Whoops!

               The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and 
               his father find themselves in the:

               INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

               Where a NAZI RADIOMAN wearing headphones sits at an elaborate 
               panel of dials, switches and meters, and a WOMAN stands over 
               a map plotting coordinates. Their backs are turned to Indy 
               and Henry.

               The floor begins to rotate again, and Indy and Henry find 
               themselves back in:

               INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

               inside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back.

                                     HENRY
                         Our situation has not improved.

               Indy glances over his shoulder at Henry.

                                     INDY
                         Listen Dad... I'm almost free.

               Indy's foot hits the grill again... and the fireplace rotates 
               to:

               INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

               FOUR NAZI RADIOMEN and the Woman are still hard at work with 
               controls and coordinates. Suddenly the Woman looks up and 
               spots Henry and Indy. She screams.

                                     WOMAN
                         Alarm!

               Now the Radioman turn to see Henry and Indy.

                                     WOMAN
                         Schnell!!

               TWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at 
               Indy and Henry

               INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAWN

               Indy and Henry rotate into the room which is now an INFERNO. 
               The carpet, drapes and furniture are all ablaze.

                                     HENRY
                         This is intolerable!

                                     INDY
                         I'm out, Dad!

               Indy finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie 
               his father.

                                     HENRY
                         Well done, boy!

               INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

               All four Radiomen now have their guns drawn. They activate 
               the lever and begin to rotate through the Secret Door.

               INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

               The Radiomen appear in the fireplace on the other side -- 
               but there is NO SIGN OF Indy and Henry.

               The Radiomen move cautiously toward the flame, shielding 
               their faces with one hand, holding their guns with the other. 
               Is it possible that Indy and Henry escaped through these 
               flames?

               Not a chance.

               They've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP 
               DOWN, BEHIND the Radiomen.

               One of the Radiomen grabs Indy by the neck. As they struggle 
               they fall against the rotating wall and disappear into the 
               next room, leaving a frightened Henry behind.

               Henry presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he 
               disappears into the next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels 
               into the room. The other Nazis rush forward to him.

               INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

               Indy picks up a BUST OF HITLER and uses it to jam the rotating 
               wall in place, sealing the Nazis inside the burning room.

               INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

               Vogel strides purposefully down the hallway. He BARKS an 
               order, and TWO MORE NAZIS fall into step with him.

               INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

               Indy grabs his whip, his leather sack and Henry's case from 
               a table. He hands the case to Henry and they begin to run.

                                     INDY
                         Come on Dad.

               INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY

               Indy and Henry step into an empty room.

                                     INDY
                         Dead end.

               Henry looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as Indy 
               searches frantically for an exit.

                                     INDY
                         There's got to be a... a secret door 
                         around. A passageway or something.

               Indy begins to run his hands over the walls -- frantic.

                                     HENRY
                         I find that if I just sit down and 
                         think...

               Henry sits on a chair which tips back, hitting the wall behind 
               it. The floor at Indy's feet suddenly begins DROPPING AWAY!

               Indy grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his 
               grip and plunges through the opening which has formed a SPIRAL 
               STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

                                     HENRY
                         ...the solution presents itself.

               Henry follows Indy down the staircase.

               INT. CAVERN / UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY

               The stairway deposits Indy and Henry into an enormous WATERY 
               CAVERN beneath the mountain on which the castle was built.

               A full-scale Nazi BOAT DOCK has been built inside the cavern. 
               We see MOTORBOATS, GUNBOATS, SUPPLY BOATS, etc.

                                     INDY
                         Great. More boats.

               Indy boards one of the motorboats and STARTS THE MOTOR.

                                     HENRY
                         Would you say this has been just 
                         another typical day for you? Huh?

               Henry tosses his case at Indy who catches it and angrily 
               throws it back to his father.

                                     INDY
                              (ironically)
                         Ooof! No! It's been better than most.

               Indy moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. Henry 
               looks confused.

                                     INDY
                         Come on, Dad. Come on!

                                     HENRY
                         What about the boat? We're not going 
                         on the boat?

               INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY

               Vogel and the Nazi Soldiers enter the room and spot the spiral 
               staircase leading below. They quickly descend the stairs.

               INT. CAVERN / UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY

               As Vogel and the Nazi Soldiers rush to the dock. Vogel sees 
               that a motorboat is missing. He orders the Nazi Soldiers 
               into a boat.

                                     VOGEL
                         Sie alle ins Boat. Schnell!

               CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL

               A large box which suddenly BREAKS APART as Indy, now on a 
               motorbike with Henry in the sidecar, ROARS PAST THE DOCK, 
               hitting TWO NAZI SOLDIERS who scream as they fall into the 
               river.

               Vogel screams after Indy and Henry as they drive off.

                                                           STRAIGHT CUT TO:

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

               Indy looks pleased as he drives the motorbike along the road, 
               but Henry appears worried.

                                     INDY
                         Ha!

               FOUR NAZI SOLDIERS ON MOTORCYCLES

               They chase down the road after Indy and Henry.

               Indy turns the motorbike down a smaller, dusty tree-lined 
               road. Henry gasps as he is jostled about in the sidecar. One 
               of the Nazi Soldiers gives chase along a higher road running 
               in the same direction.

               EXT. ROAD BARRICADE - DAY

               Indy approaches the barricade from one direction as one of 
               the Nazi Soldiers approaches from a higher road.

               A GUARD steps from the road station and calls to the vehicles 
               as Indy and Henry SMASH THROUGH THE BARRICADE.

                                     GUARD
                         Halt! Halt!

               The Nazi Soldier rides his motorcycle through the other side 
               of the barrier -- IT SHATTERS.

               INDY AND HENRY

               Indy grabs at a FLAGPOLE as they roar past -- it snaps off 
               in his hand.

               The Nazi Soldier drives his motorcycle toward Indy and Henry. 
               He unshoulders his machine gun.

               Indy uses the broken flagpole as a lance and knocks the Nazi 
               Soldier from his motorcycle.

               THE RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE

               Drives on toward the other Nazi Soldiers now approaching the 
               guardhouse, COLLIDING WITH TWO OF THEM.

               The remaining Nazi Soldier maneuvers his motorcycle around 
               his fallen comrades and continues the chase.

               INDY AND HENRY

               As the remaining Nazi Soldier rides alongside their motorbike 
               he cocks his gun, preparing to fire.

               Indy quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole 
               through the spokes of the Nazi's front wheel.

               The NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing 
               him high into the air.

               Indy glances back and smiles, but the smile fades as he looks 
               forward again to see a sign at a CROSSROAD. Arrows pointing 
               in opposite directions indicate the way to "BERLIN" or 
               "VENEDIG".

               Indy starts down the road marked "VENEDIG".

                                     HENRY
                         Stop!

                                     INDY
                         What?

                                     HENRY
                         Stop! Stop!

               The motorbike skids to a stop.

                                     HENRY
                         You're going the wrong Way! We have 
                         to get to Berlin!

                                     INDY
                              (pointing towards 
                              Venedig)
                         Brody's this way.

                                     HENRY
                         My Diary's in Berlin.

                                     INDY
                         You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus 
                         has the map.

                                     HENRY
                         There is more in the Diary than just 
                         the map.

                                     INDY
                         All right Dad -- tell me.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, he who finds the Grail must 
                         face the final challenge.

                                     INDY
                         What final challenge?

                                     HENRY
                         Three devices of such lethal cunning.

                                     INDY
                         Booby traps?

                                     HENRY
                         Oh, yes. But I found the clues that 
                         will safely take us through, in the 
                         Chronicles of St. Anselm.

                                     INDY
                         But what are they? Can't you remember?

                                     HENRY
                         I wrote them down in my Diary so 
                         that I wouldn't have to remember.

                                     INDY
                         Half the German Army's on our tail 
                         and you want me to go to Berlin? 
                         Into the lion's den?

                                     HENRY
                         Yes! The only thing that matters is 
                         the Grail.

                                     INDY
                         What about Marcus?

                                     HENRY
                         Marcus would agree with me.

                                     INDY
                         Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!

               Henry slaps him across the face. Indy is rocked to his 
               foundations, not by any means entirely by the blow itself.

                                     HENRY
                         That's for blasphemy. The quest for 
                         the Grail is not archaeology. It's a 
                         race against evil. If it is captured 
                         by the Nazis, the armies of darkness 
                         will march all over the face of the 
                         earth. Do you understand me?

                                     INDY
                         This is an obsession Dad. I never 
                         understood it. Never. Neither did 
                         Mom.

                                     HENRY
                         Oh yes, she did. Only too well. 
                         Unfortunately she kept her illness 
                         from me until all I could do was 
                         mourn her.

               EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

               Arrows point in opposite directions to VENICE and BERLIN. 
               The CAMERA MOVES IN on the portion of the sign reading BERLIN.

               EXT. CITY SQUARE - BERLIN - NIGHT

               A Nazi Rally -- a book-burning is in process.

               The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by 
               the minute as College Students and Nazi Brownshirts 
               continually toss more books onto the fire.

               Flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are 
               waved rhythmically from side to side in a motion that echoes 
               the mounting frenzy of the enormous crowd.

               Indy and Henry walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform 
               of a Nazi Soldier. He is now buttoning up the tunic -- which 
               happens to be several sizes too big.

                                     HENRY
                         My boy, we are Pilgrims in an unholy 
                         land.

               Then... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. 
               WE PAN ALONG HIS LINE OF SIGHT to:

               THE PODIUM

               Where high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking 
               ADOLF HITLER as they oversee the rally.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Elsa is walking away in an open area, background of torches, 
               vehicles, Nazi Officers... one of whom is now none other 
               than Indy, coming up to her before she knows he is there. 
               His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.

                                     INDY
                         Fraulein Doctor. Where is it?

               Still startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is 
               even now a lover in her thoughts.

                                     ELSA
                         How did you get here?

                                     INDY
                         Where is it? I want it.

               Indy pushes Elsa against a column and begins to search her 
               clothing for the Diary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket.

                                     ELSA
                         You came back for the book? Why?

                                     INDY
                         My father didn't want it incinerated.

               She understands him. It's as though he slapped her.

                                     ELSA
                         Is that what you think of me? I 
                         believe in the Grail, not the 
                         Swastika.

                                     INDY
                              (vicious)
                         Yet you stood up to be counted with 
                         the enemy of everything the Grail 
                         stands for -- who gives a damn what 
                         you think?

                                     ELSA
                              (hard and fast)
                         You do.

               Now it's as though she'd slapped him back. His hands fly to 
               her neck.

                                     INDY
                         All I have to do is squeeze.

                                     ELSA
                         All I have to do is scream.

               It's a standoff emotionally. He knows he'd never do it. she 
               knows it too. And the same goes for screaming.

               Indy releases her and backs away. She looks at him with a 
               lover's pain. He moves over to Henry.

                                     INDY
                         I've got it. Let's get the hell out 
                         of here.

               They move off and almost run headlong into Hitler and his 
               entire entourage coming down from the Podium. 50 kids push 
               their autograph books for Hitler's signature.

               Hitler pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They 
               make eye contact. It only lasts a moment but the moment is 
               electric.

               Hitler breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, 
               opens it to the first page and signs his autograph. He hands 
               it back and moves on.

               EXT. AIRFIELD - BERLIN, GERMANY - DAY

               Indy's motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal.

               INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - DAY

               A Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing HENRY'S 
               PICTURE to Nazi Soldiers inside the terminal.

               Henry leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as Indy enters 
               down the stairs and taps Henry's shoulder.

               They begin to walk toward the boarding gates.

                                     HENRY
                         What did you get?

                                     INDY
                         I don't know. The first available 
                         flight out of Germany.

                                     HENRY
                         Good.

               Indy and Henry show their papers to the Boarding Guards, 
               then join the line of passengers, which has already begun to 
               move toward a:

               MOORED ZEPPELIN

               Ten stories tall and longer than two football fields: Flying 
               in the grand tradition!

               INT. THE ZEPPELIN - PASSENGER COMPARTMENT - DAY

               The Zeppelin is about to take off. Indy and Henry make 
               themselves comfortable in one of the compartments.

                                     INDY
                         Well, we made it.

               Henry looks over his newspaper at Indy.

                                     HENRY
                         When we're airborne, with Germany 
                         behind us, then I'll share that 
                         sentiment.

                                     INDY
                         Relax.

               But Indy looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when 
               he sees:

               VOGEL AND A GESTAPO AGENT

               Rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin.

                                     VOGEL
                         Nicht zumachen! Wir steigen ein!

               INDY

               Sits back in his chair, looks to Henry, now reading his 
               newspaper.

               A Steward enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in 
               front of Indy and Henry, then continues down the aisle of 
               passengers. Indy follows after the Steward. He puts his arm 
               around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk up a 
               flight of stairs.

               VOGEL

               Now walks up the aisle. He approaches a MALE PASSENGER hidden 
               behind a newspaper. Vogel uses his walking stick to lower 
               the newspaper and show the Passenger the leaflet with Henry's 
               photograph.

                                     VOGEL
                         Haben sie diesen Mann gesehen?

               The Passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative. 
               Vogel shows the picture to other Passengers.

                                     FEMALE PASSENGER
                         Nein.

                                     INDY (O.S.)
                         Fahrscheine, bitte.

                                     MALE PASSENGER
                         Nein.

               Vogel turns to see:

               INDY -- WEARING THE HAT AND JACKET OF THE CHIEF STEWARD

                                     MALE PASSENGER (O.S.)
                         Ich habe ihn nicht gesehen.

                                     INDY
                         Tickets please.

               The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English.

                                     INDY
                         Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte.

               VOGEL

               Approaches Henry, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, 
               Vogel uses his walking stick to lower the paper, revealing 
               Henry's face.

                                     VOGEL
                         Guten Tag, Herr Jones.

               Now Indy, still playing the role of Steward, asks Vogel for 
               his ticket.

                                     INDY
                         Fahrscheine mein Herr.

                                     VOGEL
                         Weg.

                                     INDY
                         Tickets please.

               Henry looks confused.

                                     VOGEL
                              (in German)
                         Was?

               Vogel glances up and recognizes Indy -- who quickly punches 
               Vogel in the face, knocking him toward the window. In another 
               quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT THE WINDOW onto the tarmac 
               below.

               Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment.

                                     INDY
                              (in German; with a 
                              shrug)
                         No ticket.

               Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it 
               in Indy's face.

               EXT. AIRFIELD TARMAC - DAY

               Vogel gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the 
               sky above him, revealing an airplane attached to the belly 
               of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at the rising Zeppelin.

                                     VOGEL
                         Du wirst nochmal horen von mir!

               INT. ZEPPELIN - DAY

               Indy and Henry together again in their compartment.

                                     HENRY
                         You know, sharing your adventures is 
                         an interesting experience.

                                     INDY
                              (meaning Elsa)
                         That's not all we shared. It's 
                         disgraceful. You're old enough to be 
                         her fa... er, her grandfather!

                                     HENRY
                         Well, I'm as human as the next man.

                                     INDY
                         I was the next man.

                                     HENRY
                              (laughs)
                         Ships that pass in the night...

               Henry opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it.

                                     INDY
                         Do you remember the last time we had 
                         a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.

                                     HENRY
                         Hmmm... What did we talk about?

                                     INDY
                         We didn't talk. We never talked.

                                     HENRY
                         And do I detect a rebuke?

                                     INDY
                         A regret. It was just the two of us, 
                         Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. 
                         For you, too. If you had been an 
                         ordinary, average father like the 
                         other guys' dads, you'd have 
                         understood that.

                                     HENRY
                         Actually, I was a wonderful father.

                                     INDY
                         When?

               Henry looks up from his Diary.

                                     HENRY
                         Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to 
                         bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? 
                         No. I respected your privacy and I 
                         taught you self-reliance.

                                     INDY
                         What you taught me was that I was 
                         less important to you than people 
                         who had been dead for five hundred 
                         years in another country. And I 
                         learned it so well that we've hardly 
                         spoken for twenty years.

                                     HENRY
                         You left just when you were becoming 
                         interesting.

                                     INDY
                         Dad, how can you?

                                     HENRY
                              (interrupting)
                         Very well. I'm here now.

               He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat.

                                     HENRY
                         What do you want to talk about? Hmmm?

               Indy stutters uncomfortably as Henry stares at him, waiting 
               for a response.

                                     INDY
                              (laughs)
                         Well... I can't think of anything.

                                     HENRY
                         Then what are you complaining about?
                              (laughs)
                         Look, we have work to do. When we 
                         get to Alexandretta we will face 
                         three challenges.
                              (he reads from the 
                              Diary)
                         "First, the breath of God. Only the 
                         penitent man will pass. Second, the 
                         Word of God, only in the footsteps 
                         of God will he proceed. Third, the 
                         Path of God, only in the leap from 
                         the lion's head will he prove his 
                         worth."

                                     INDY
                         What does that mean?

                                     HENRY
                              (laughs)
                         I don't know. We'll find out.

               Sunlight falls across the table from the window. Indy reaches 
               for the drink. The bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a 
               clock over the tabletop across the drinks.

               We see Indy puzzled. Only for a moment.

                                     INDY
                         They're turning around. They're taking 
                         us back to Germany.

               INT. FRAMEWORK OF ZEPPELIN - DAY

               Indy and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly 
               of the Zeppelin. The Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is 
               exposed.

               Indy and Henry hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a 
               PAIR OF DOORWAYS framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin.

                                     INDY
                         Well, I thought it would take them a 
                         lot longer to figure out the radio 
                         was dead. Come on, Dad. Move!

               Then Indy opens the doors. We see plenty of blue sky and 
               white clouds. We also see a small BI-PLANE that is suspended 
               from the Zeppelin by a HOOK & CRANE DEVICE.

                                     INDY
                         Come on, Dad. Come on!

               EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY

               Indy climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as Henry takes 
               the tail gunner's seat.

                                     HENRY
                              (with delight)
                         I didn't know you could fly a plane.

                                     INDY
                         Fly... yes. Land... no.

               INT. THE BIPLANE - DAY

               Indy turns in his seat to give Henry the "thumbs up." Henry 
               smiles valiantly and points down to the ground.

               Then they both become aware of a STRANGE SOUND in the skies 
               behind them. Something between a ROAR and a WAIL. TWO 
               MESSERSCHMIDT FIGHTER BOMBERS streak out of the clouds and 
               race across the sky.

               INDY AND HENRY

               Shrink in their seats as the MESSERSCHMIDTS (going three 
               times as fast as they are) SCREAM past on either side.

                                     INDY
                         Dad, you're gonna have to use the 
                         machine gun. Get it ready.

               Henry turns and grips the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN with a perplexed 
               expression.

                                     INDY
                              (turning; pointing)
                         Eleven o'clock!

               Henry pulls out his watch.

                                     INDY
                         Dad -- eleven o'clock!!

                                     HENRY
                         What happens at eleven o'clock?

               Indy uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a 
               direction and not a time.

                                     INDY
                              (frustrated)
                         Twelve -- eleven -- ten. Eleven 
                         o'clock. Fire!

               Henry does -- and the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of 
               his seat.

               Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage. The 
               speeding Messerschmidts continually overshoot him, WHIZZING 
               past in a blur -- making wide turns miles away in the sky.

               Henry has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls 
               back on the trigger -- RATTA-A-TAT-TAT! RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!

               The Messerschmidt banks to the left, but Henry keeps it in 
               his gun sight. Henry swings the gun around, inadvertently 
               CUTTING HIS OWN REAR STABILIZER IN HALF.

                                     INDY
                         Dad, are we hit?!

                                     HENRY
                         More or less.
                              (pause)
                         Son, I'm sorry. They got us.

               Indy looks back at the missing tail section, then at his 
               father.

               The plane begins to go down. Indy struggles to control its 
               descent.

                                     INDY
                         Hang on, Dads We're going in!

               Henry slumps down fearfully in his seat.

               EXT. A FIELD - DAY

               The wheels of the plane touch down. OUT OF CONTROL, the PLANE 
               SKIDS and CRASHES first into a corral of goats and then into 
               the farmhouse beyond sending a cloud of dust into the air.

               As Indy pulls himself from the cockpit:

                                     HENRY
                              (sarcastic)
                         Nice landing.

                                     INDY
                         Thanks.

               Suddenly, Indy's attention is directed to:

               TWO SCREAMING MESSERSCHMIDTS

               Coming in low. Guns BLAZING.

               As BULLETS EXPLODE around them, Indy and Henry jump over a 
               stone barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy.

                                     HENRY
                         Those people are trying to kill us!

                                     INDY
                         I know, Dad!

                                     HENRY
                         It's a new experience for me.

                                     INDY
                         It happens to me all the time.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               An OLD MAN kneels at his car repairing a rear tire.

               The Man turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly 
               the wheel moves forward, startling the Old Man.

               INT. THE CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

               Indy has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the 
               steering wheel. Henry is a very nervous passenger.

               Indy sees a LOW-FLYING MESSERSCHMIDT coming up behind him in 
               the SIDE MIRROR.

               As the Messerschmidt ROARS by overhead, BULLETS EXPLODE around 
               them, narrowly missing the car.

                                     HENRY
                         This is intolerable!

                                     INDY
                         This could be close.

               EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY

               The car races toward a TUNNEL that cuts through a steep 
               MOUNTAINSIDE.

               The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns 
               CHATTERING.

               The car ENTERS the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up 
               in time. It SLAMS into the MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, SHEARING OFF 
               its WINGS.

               INT. THE TUNNEL - DAY

               The FLAMING FUSELAGE continues to ROCKET through the tunnel 
               like a bullet down the muzzle of a gun. SPARKS fly as its 
               belly SCRAPES against the pavement and the sides of the 
               tunnel.

               INT. THE CAR - DAY

               Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless 
               BALL OF FIRE gaining on them; about to overtake them.

                                     HENRY
                         Faster, boy -- faster!

               EXT. THE ROAD - OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

               The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the road. 
               The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and EXPLODES 
               in the middle of the road.

               INT. THE CAR - DAY

               As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the 
               sweat from his brow.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, they don't come any closer 
                         than that!

               Henry looks out the windshield and sees the second 
               Messerschmidt SCREAMING out of the sky toward them.

               EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY

               The MESSERSCHMIDT drops its single UNDER-FUSELAGE BOMB. It 
               EXPLODES in the road directly ahead of the car, missing it 
               by only several feet.

               THE CAR

               FALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Indy climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater. He 
               turns back to Henry.

                                     INDY
                         Dad, he's coming back.

               Indy and Henry run down the mountainside to:

               DESERTED MEDITERRANEAN BEACH - DAY

               Indy and Henry run to the shoreline. Indy reaches for his 
               gun, tucked in his pants. He opens the chamber -- the GUN 
               HAS NO BULLETS.

               THE MESSERSCHMIDT

               Swings around and is coming in for another pass.

               INDY AND HENRY

               Exchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about 
               running: there is no place to run to. Henry hands his case 
               to Indy.

               Holding his umbrella, Henry suddenly spins around and runs 
               screaming and shouting into A FLOCK OF SEA GULLS...

               The SEA GULLS take to the wing in flight. Thousands of them.

               INDY

               Bullets kick up sand leading up to him... then --

               THE MESSERSCHMIDT AND THE SEA GULLS

               Meet in midair. MASSACRE! Sea gulls are shredded by the 
               Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a FEATHERY 
               WHITE PUREE that SPLATTERS against the cockpit and CLOGS THE 
               ENGINE.

               ENGINE SPUTTERS... STALLS... Silence. The Messerschmidt falls 
               from the skies and EXPLODES in an OFF CAMERA SOUND EFFECT.

               Indy stands as before -- stunned -- a statue.

               Henry walks back to Indy.

                                     HENRY
                         I suddenly remembered Charlemagne. 
                         "Let my armies be the rocks and the 
                         trees and the birds in the sky."
                              (he chuckles)

               Indy wears a proud expression as he watches Henry walk down 
               the beach.

               EXT. MOSQUE - DAY

               FADE IN TITLE: "REPUBLIC OF HATAY"

               FADE OUT TITLE

               EXT. COURTYARD OF SULTAN'S PALACE - ISKENDERUN - DAY

               The Sultan is seated in his royal chair, flanked by Walter 
               Donovan and Vogel and surrounded by his minions.

               Donovan holds the missing Grail Diary pages.

                                     DONOVAN
                         These pages are taken from Professor 
                         Jones' diary, Your Highness. And 
                         they include a map that pinpoints 
                         the exact location of the Grail.

               Donovan and the Sultan walk together through an archway.

                                     DONOVAN
                         As you can see, the Grail is all but 
                         in our hands.
                              (beat)
                         However, Your Highness, we would not 
                         think of crossing your soil without 
                         your permission, nor of removing the 
                         Grail from your borders without 
                         suitable compensation.

                                     SULTAN
                         What have you brought?

                                     VOGEL
                         Bring den Schatz!

               TWO NAZI SOLDIERS bring forward a HUGE STEAMER TRUNK. They 
               open the lid and begin to empty it of its contents:

               Gold and silver objects of every description.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Precious valuables, Your Highness, 
                         "donated" by some of the finest 
                         families in all of Germany.

               The Sultan gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk. 
               He goes right past it and begins to inspect the Nazi staff 
               car parked nearby.

                                     SULTAN
                         Rolls-Royce Phantom Two. 4.3 litre, 
                         30 horsepower, six cylinder engine, 
                         with Stromberg Downdraft carburetor.

               The Sultan points to the engine under the hood.

                                     SULTAN
                         Can go from zero to 100 kilometres 
                         an hour in 12.5 seconds. And I even 
                         like the color.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (after a beat)
                         The keys are in the ignition, Your 
                         Highness.

                                     SULTAN
                         You shall have camels, horses, an 
                         armed escort, provisions, desert 
                         vehicles -- and tanks!

                                     DONOVAN
                         You're welcome.

               Somebody else is also taking note... and we see that it is 
               Kazim, the spy at the court.

               Elsa is revealed coming down the stairs toward Donovan and 
               Vogel.

                                     ELSA
                         We have no time to lose. Indiana 
                         Jones and his father have escaped.

               EXT. ISKENDERUN STREET - DAY

               Sallah drives his car through the crowded streets, Indy beside 
               him and Henry in the back seat.

                                     SALLAH
                         We go this way.

               Sallah waves his arms and shouts to a CAMEL HERDER.

                                     SALLAH
                         Get that camel out of the way!

                                     INDY
                         What happened to Marcus, Sallah?

                                     SALLAH
                              (overlapping)
                         Ah, they set out across the desert 
                         this afternoon. I believe they took 
                         Mister Brody with them.

               Henry removes his hat and hits Indy with it.

                                     HENRY
                         Now they have the map! And in this 
                         sort of race, there's no silver medal 
                         for finishing second.

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               Elsa and Donovan's party -- consisting of a SUPPLY TRUCK, 
               OPEN CAR, TURKISH SOLDIERS RIDING CAMELS, SPARE HORSES AND A 
               TANK AND VARIOUS OTHER VEHICLES -- all moving along through 
               the ramble of this box canyon.

               Elsa, Donovan and Vogel travel in the open car. The TANK is 
               a vintage World War I model with enormous treads. The Turkish 
               soldiers wear native dress and carry both carbines and sabers.

               Brody sits alongside Elsa in the rear of the car carrying 
               Donovan. Donovan hands a canteen back to him.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?

                                     BRODY
                         I'd rather spit in your face. But as 
                         I haven't got any spit...

               Vogel snatches the canteen away from Brody before he can 
               drink.

                                     VOGEL
                         We must be within three or four miles. 
                         Otherwise we are off the map.

               He hands the map to Elsa, drinks from the canteen, and hands 
               that back to Donovan.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of 
                         the recovery of the greatest artifact 
                         in the history of mankind.

                                     BRODY
                         You're meddling with powers you cannot 
                         possibly comprehend.

               Henry and Sallah are at Indy's side as he views Donovan's 
               party in the distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all 
               of their supplies.

                                     INDY
                         Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay. 
                         They've got a tank. Six-pound gun.

               Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills.

               What he sees is:

               THE SUN REFLECTING OFF THE LENSES OF INDY'S BINOCULARS

                                     HENRY
                         What do you think you're doing?! Get 
                         down!

                                     INDY
                         Dad, we're well out of range.

               At that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction.

               It WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. Indy, Henry 
               and Sallah cover their heads as automobile fragments rain 
               down upon them.

                                     SALLAH
                         That car belonged to my brother-in-
                         law.

                                     INDY
                              (gesturing to the 
                              others)
                         Come on -- come on!

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

                                     VOGEL
                         I can't see anyone up there.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Maybe it wasn't even Jones.

                                     ELSA
                         No. It's him all right. He's here 
                         somewhere.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (to Vogel)
                         Put Brody in the tank.

               Kazim peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group 
               below.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (to Elsa)
                         Well, in this sun, without 
                         transportation, they're as good as 
                         dead.

               BULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. Donovan and Elsa 
               duck.

               A NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around 
               him.

               KAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to 
               FIRE. Elsa and Donovan take cover beside the parked car.

                                     DONOVAN
                         It's Jones, all right.

               ANGLE ON INDY'S GROUP

               Indy and Henry, followed by Sallah, take cover behind a rock 
               to watch Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire 
               below them.

                                     HENRY
                         Now, who are all these people?

                                     INDY
                         Who cares? As long as they're keeping 
                         Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here 
                         while Sallah and I organize some 
                         transportation.

               CUT BACK to the action. The BRETHREN are firing at the Donovan 
               party and are being fired on by the Donovan party.

               TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They 
               EXPLODE, killing one of Kazim's Brethren.

               The battle continues -- a fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, 
               GRENADES and MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides.

               INDY AND SALLAH

               Crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the 
               battle run amongst camels and horses.

                                     INDY
                         I'm going after those horses.

                                     SALLAH
                         I'll take the camels.

                                     INDY
                         I don't need camels.

                                     SALLAH
                         But, Indy --

                                     INDY
                         No camels!

               DONOVAN AND ELSA

               They look down at Kazim who lies mortally wounded on the 
               ground at their feet. Elsa looks saddened.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (re: Kazim)
                         Who is he?

                                     KAZIM
                         A messenger from God. For the 
                         unrighteous, the Cup of Life holds 
                         everlasting damnation.

               Kazim dies.

               INDY

               Leaps atop a TURKISH SOLDIER on horseback, pulling the man 
               and the horse to the ground. A SECOND TURK comes to assist 
               his comrade; Indy mounts the horse, knocking both Turks to 
               the ground.

               INT. THE TANK - DAY

               Brody has been left alone in the tank. Henry climbs down 
               into the tank and taps Brody on the shoulder, startling him.

                                     HENRY
                         Marcus!

                                     BRODY
                         Arghhh! Oh!

               They exchange an old University Club toast, swinging their 
               arms at one another and missing. Then Henry flaps his arms 
               and tugs his ears.

                                     HENRY
                         "Genius of the Restoration --"

               Now Brody tugs his ears, flaps his arms and touches his head.

                                     BRODY
                         "-- aid our own resuscitation!"

               They exchange a handshake.

                                     BRODY
                         Henry! What are you doing here?!

                                     HENRY
                         It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.

               As Henry starts to climb out of the tank, TWO NAZI SOLDIERS 
               DROP DOWN from above, their Lugers drawn. They are followed 
               by Vogel.

                                     VOGEL
                              (re: Henry)
                         Search him.

               The Nazi Soldiers point their guns at Henry and Brody.

                                     VOGEL
                              (to Henry)
                         What is in this book? That miserable 
                         little Diary of yours!

               Vogel removes a glove and slaps Henry with it.

                                     VOGEL
                         Here's the map. The book is useless, 
                         and yet you come all the way back to 
                         Berlin to get it. Why?

               He slaps Henry again.

                                     VOGEL
                         What are you hiding?

               Another slap.

                                     VOGEL
                         What does the Diary tell you that it 
                         doesn't tell us?!

               Vogel reaches out to slap Henry yet again, but Henry grabs 
               his arm, stopping him.

                                     HENRY
                         It tells me that goose-stepping morons 
                         like yourself should try reading 
                         books instead of burning them.

               Donovan appears at the turret cover.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Colonel? Jones is getting away.

                                     VOGEL
                              (indicating Henry)
                         I think not, Herr Donovan.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

                                     DONOVAN
                         Not that Jones -- the other Jones!

                                     NAZI SOLDIER
                         Herr Colonel!

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               Indy rides away on one horse, leading three others as he 
               goes.

               Sallah approaches on horseback leading five camels.

                                     INDY
                         Sallah, I said no camels! That's 
                         five camels. Can't you Count?

                                     SALLAH
                         Compensation for my brother-in-law's 
                         car. Indy, your father and Brody --

                                     INDY
                         Where's my father?

                                     SALLAH
                         They have them. In the belly of that 
                         steel beast.

               Indy and Sallah charge forward leading their horses and 
               camels.

               Then Vogel commands the Tank Driver to give chase.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Vogel shouts to the Tank Driver.

                                     VOGEL
                         Fire!

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               The tank starts firing at Indy on horseback. Indy zigs and 
               zags as the tank fires two rounds at Indy, barely missing 
               him. Each time Indy emerges from the plume of desert dust, 
               hanging like a toadstool in the air.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Henry and Brody hold their hands over their ears.

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               Donovan shouts orders to the Troops. Indy is followed by 
               various vehicles in the caravan.

               Indy notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can 
               only pivot so far. Indy makes a mental note of this and while 
               riding right in front of the tank, turns his horse completely 
               around, 180 degrees. The tank starts to follow.

               POV THROUGH THE VIEWING PORT

               Vogel watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to 
               catch up with Indy.

               Cleverly, Indy has turned the tank directly into a head-on 
               collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a 
               Kubelwagon.

               The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German 
               military sedan becoming lodged between the treads while 
               blocking the front view and any use of the six-pound cannon 
               on the turret.

               Indy, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone 
               from the wall of a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling 
               the tank, as everyone scurries about inside, looking through 
               viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Vogel shouts to the GUNNER.

                                     VOGEL
                         Den Kubelwagon sprengen!

               The Gunner puts a shell into the large gun. He FIRES, 
               CATAPULTING THE KUBELWAGON into the air, where it EXPLODES. 
               The tank drives through the resulting smoke an dust, then 
               rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it.

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               Indy gallops up to the side cannon and jams the stone down 
               the barrel, lodging several rocks inside. Then he steers his 
               horse directly in range of that gun.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               A NAZI SOLDIER pushes Henry away from the window.

                                     NAZI SOLDIER
                         Keine Bewegung.

               He points his gun at Henry and Brody.

                                     NAZI SOLDIER
                         Keine Bewegung.

               The smaller gun, blocked by the rocks, BACKFIRES, blowing 
               the breech out into the face of the gunner, killing him and 
               filling the tank with smoke.

               Brody, Henry, Vogel and the driver begin to choke.

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               Indy rides his horse alongside the tank.

                                     INDY
                         Dad! Dad! Dad!

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Henry and Brody still held at gunpoint by the Nazi Soldier.

                                     HENRY
                         Junior? Junior? Junior!

               The Nazi Soldier swings his fist, knocking Henry off his 
               seat.

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. 
               Vogel emerges and aims his gun at Indy.

               Indy and Vogel EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his 
               horse.

               Indy pulls the trigger again -- his gun is empty! Indy 
               immediately takes the high trail.

               Now Indy is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. 
               He moves out of the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse 
               onto the trundling tank.

               CLOSEUP - VOGEL

               Hate-staring at Indy.

               CLOSEUP - INDY

               Hate-staring back at Vogel.

               Suddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies INTO FRAME, 
               tackling Indy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SIDE ANGLE

               One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and 
               like pirates boarding a galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the 
               treads and are swarming all over Indy.

               Indy is struggling with a German's Luger.

               Indy presses the Luger against his assailant and forces the 
               Nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself. The bullet not only 
               passes through the Nazi, but passes through two other Nazis 
               standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top and 
               three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in 
               disbelief.

               Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises 
               his knife as he grabs Indy. They struggle and fall.

               Indy sits up to see Vogel standing over him. Vogel wraps a 
               chain around Indy's neck.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Indy appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about 
               his neck and held by Vogel.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

               He drops the gun down into the tank.

                                     INDY
                         Dad! Dad! Get it!

               Vogel pulls Indy from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain 
               wrapped around his neck.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

               A NAZI SOLDIER approaches.

               Indy hits him, knocking him onto the tank tread. The Nazi 
               Soldier screams as he is dragged under the rolling tank.

               Now Indy and Vogel struggle with one another, the chain still 
               wrapped around Indy's neck.

               INT. TANK - DAY - THROUGH THE PERISCOPE

               We see Indy and Vogel struggling atop the tank. Indy lifts 
               his feet, lunging toward the periscope and pulling Vogel 
               with him.

               Indy's face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               The Nazi Soldier looking through the periscope pulls away 
               from it, smiles, then turns back to it.

               THROUGH THE PERISCOPE

               Indy's face, still pressed against the lens.

               Vogel pulls Indy from the periscope.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               The Nazi Soldier pulls away from the periscope again.

                                     PERISCOPE SOLDIER
                              (laughing)
                         Diese Amerikaner. Sie kämpfen wie 
                         Weiber.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

               Indy now lies on top of Vogel. He kicks out at the periscope 
               which spins around.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               The periscope handle spins around and hits the PERISCOPE 
               SOLDIER in the head. He falls against the Nazi Soldier 
               guarding Henry and Brody.

               Henry pushes the Nazi Soldier aside and grabs the gun. The 
               Periscope Soldier struggles to take the gun from Henry.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

               Vogel holds the chain around Indy's neck, pushing his head 
               downward toward the revolving tread.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               The Periscope Soldier holds Henry from behind, forcing the 
               gun toward him. Henry reaches down and pulls a fountain pen 
               from his coat pocket.

               As the Periscope Soldier pulls on Henry's face, Henry lifts 
               the fountain pen and squirts ink into his face. The Soldier 
               falls, his head smashing into the wall of the tank. At the 
               same time, Henry loses his grip on the gun which falls to 
               the floor.

                                     BRODY
                         Henry, the pen --

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     BRODY
                         But don't you see? The pen is mightier 
                         than the sword.

               EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

               A troop truck pulls near the tank.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Henry fires the TANK GUN at the troop truck. SOLDIERS FLY 
               INTO THE AIR. The TROOP TRUCK flips over and EXPLODES.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

               The EXPLOSION knocks Indy off the tank and onto the tread. 
               He grabs onto the shredded gun protruding from the side of 
               the tank.

               Vogel looks down at Indy and smiles smugly.

               The tank is approaching a cliff wall. As Indy tries to secure 
               footing, Vogel steps on his hands.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Brody looks at Henry.

                                     BRODY
                         Look what you did!

                                     HENRY
                         It's war.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

               Vogel now swings a shovel at Indy, smashing at his hands.

               Brody climbs up out of the tank, followed by Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         Didn't I tell you it was a rescue, 
                         huh?

               A NAZI SOLDIER appears and pulls Henry down.

               Vogel raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing 
               down on Indy, still hanging from the protruding gun.

               Indy loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended 
               only by the strap of his leather pouch. He screams as the 
               gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending stones tumbling 
               down over him.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               The Nazi Soldier knocks Henry into a pile of boxes, then 
               punches him in the face.

               As the Soldier raises the gun to Henry's face, Brody hits 
               him over the head with a canister. The Soldier falls, 
               discharging the gun into the air.

               The BULLET RICOCHETS around the tank, past the Tank Driver 
               who is manipulating levers at the control panel. SPARKS FLY; 
               then the BULLET PINGS AGAINST THE WINDOW and RICOCHETS ONCE 
               MORE, this time passing THROUGH THE TANK DRIVER'S HAT. Blood 
               flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver slumps forward, 
               his body depressing the levers.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

               Indy still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the 
               tank swerves, barely missing the rocks and causing Vogel to 
               fall. Indy finally manages to pull himself atop the tank 
               once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then peers 
               down to Henry, still inside the tank.

                                     INDY
                         Dad?

                                     HENRY
                         You call this archaeology?

                                     INDY
                         Get out of there, Dad!

               Indy pulls Henry and Brody from the tank. Vogel pulls himself 
               back atop the tank armed again with the shovel which he swings 
               at Indy, who ducks and grabs Vogel's arm.

                                     BRODY
                         How does one get off this thing?

               As Indy winds up to punch Vogel he catches Brody in the face 
               on the backswing, then completes the movement and knocks 
               Vogel down.

               INT. TANK - DAY

               Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor.

               EXT. TANK - DAY

                                     HENRY
                              (to Indy)
                         Where's Marcus?!

               Before Indy can answer, Vogel is up and swinging with the 
               shovel. Indy ducks but the shovel catches Henry sending him 
               over the side and onto the moving tread.

               Indy grabs his whip, knocking Vogel aside.

               As Henry speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, 
               Indy, with lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping 
               the end of the whip around Henry's right ankle.

                                     INDY
                         Dad!

               Henry is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. Indy 
               struggles to hold onto the end of the bullwhip.

                                     INDY
                         Hang on, Dad!

               Sallah draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez 
               to Henry.

                                     SALLAH
                         Father of Indy -- give me your hand!

               Vogel now punches Indy in the back and grabs him around the 
               neck. Still, Indy refuses to let go of the whip.

                                     INDY
                         Sallah! Get Dad!

               Sallah reaches out to Henry.

                                     SALLAH
                         Give me your hand!

               Sallah manages to hold onto Henry as he brings his horse to 
               a stop just at the cliff's edge.

               Indy finally frees himself of Vogel's grasp, twisting his 
               arm painfully away from Indy's neck, then landing a hard 
               blow to Vogel's head.

               INDY

               Looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled 
               with horror. We see his HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's 
               edge.

               VOGEL

               He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top 
               of his lungs!

               LONG SHOT

               The tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM.

               EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DAY

               Henry, Brody and Sallah look down at the flaming wreckage of 
               the tank.

                                     HENRY
                         Junior?!

               We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING.

                                     SALLAH
                         Indy?!

                                     HENRY
                         Oh, God. I've lost him. And I never 
                         told him anything. I just wasn't 
                         ready, Marcus. Five minutes would 
                         have been enough.

               And then... looking dazed and bewildered, Indy STAGGERS UP 
               BEHIND THEM. He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, 
               looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered 
               expression.

               Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence.

               Henry says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with 
               emotion. Finally, he throws his arms around him.

                                     HENRY
                         I thought I'd lost you, boy.

               After a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of 
               his father's embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long 
               time -- if ever. And it touches him. He hugs his father back.

                                     INDY
                         I thought you had too, sir.

               Brody and Sallah are moved by this sudden reconciliation.

                                     HENRY
                         Well -- well done! Come on!

               Henry pats Indy on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard 
               on the rocky cliff edge.

               Unaware, Henry, Sallah and Brody start to walk away. Henry 
               turns back to see Indy still sitting on the ground.

                                     HENRY
                         Let's go then. why are you sitting 
                         there resting when we're so near the 
                         end? Come on -- let's go!

               Henry turns and walks toward the horse with Brody and Sallah. 
               Suddenly the FEDORA, borne on the wind, BLOWS INTO SCENE and 
               lands at Indy's feet.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

               Donovan peers through binoculars to see the CANYON OF THE 
               CRESCENT MOON. He lowers the binoculars and turns to Elsa.

                                     DONOVAN
                         The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

               Now Elsa peers through the binoculars.

               EXT. SECRET CANYON - DAY

               Indy, Henry, Sallah and Brody ride into the canyon. They 
               hear a WAILING WIND. Feel the biting cold. And sense the 
               danger.

               Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city. Its 
               spectacular Grecian facade is carved directly into the rock. 
               It is a stunning sight. The vehicles, camels and horses 
               belonging to Donovan's party have been left at the entrance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TEMPLE - DAY

               Indy, Sallah, Henry and Brody creep forward to see:

               THE TERRIFIED FACE OF A TURKISH SOLDIER

               He's walking slowly. Eyes darting. Muttering a prayer under 
               his breath. What's going on here?

               FULL SHOT - INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN TEMPLE

               The Turk stands alone in the center of the Temple. It is 
               very dark. GIANT COLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter.

               ELSA AND DONOVAN

               Watch him from a safe distance.

               THE TURK

               Is about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES 
               DEAD. We don't notice it right away, but the dead soldier 
               has been DECAPITATED.

               The Turk stops -- only one step away from the beheaded 
               soldier.

               THE TURK

               Takes one more step -- a fatal step, it turns out. We hear a 
               ROAR -- A WHOOSH of air -- but we SEE NOTHING -- except THE 
               TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND BOUNCE across the ground.

               Indy, Henry, Brody and Sallah react to the sight.

               ELSA AND DONOVAN

               She looks at him, horrified.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Helmut, another volunteer!

               TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly...

               The SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to 
               discover Indy and his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. 
               Indy's group are relieved of their guns.

               FULL SHOT - THE TEMPLE

               Indy, Henry, Brody and Sallah are brought forward by the 
               Nazi Soldiers.

               Elsa's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead. She controls 
               herself and continues more coldly.

                                     ELSA
                              (to Indy)
                         I never expected to see you again.

                                     INDY
                         I'm like a bad penny. I always turn 
                         up.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Step back now, Doctor Schneider. 
                         Give Doctor Jones some room. He's 
                         going to recover the Grail for us.

               Indy laughs.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Impossible? What do you say, Jones? 
                         Ready to go down in history?

                                     INDY
                         As what? A Nazi stooge like you?

                                     DONOVAN
                              (scornfully)
                         Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your 
                         vision?! The Nazis want to write 
                         themselves into the Grail legend and 
                         take on the world. Well, they're 
                         welcome. But I want the Grail itself. 
                         The cup that gives everlasting life. 
                         Hitler can have the world, but he 
                         can't take it with him. I'm going to 
                         be drinking my own health when he's 
                         gone the way of the Dodo.
                              (he draws his pistol)
                         The Grail is mine, and you're going 
                         to get it for me.

                                     INDY
                         Shooting me won't get you anywhere.

                                     DONOVAN
                         You know something, Doctor Jones? 
                         You're absolutely right.

               Then Donovan shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS Henry. 
               The bullet enters his side below the ribs.

                                     INDY
                         Dad?!

                                     HENRY
                         Junior...

                                     ELSA
                         No!!

                                     DONOVAN
                              (to Elsa)
                         Get back!

               Henry collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. Brody and 
               Sallah rush to his assistance.

               Indy spins toward Donovan with murder in his eyes.

               Donovan points the gun at him:

                                     DONOVAN
                         You can't save him when you're dead.

               Indy hesitates.

                                     DONOVAN
                         The healing power of the Grail is 
                         the only thing that can save your 
                         father now. It's time to ask yourself 
                         what you believe.

               Indy takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a 
               few yards in front of him. He walks to the entranceway, 
               flanked by two stone lions. We get silent reaction shots -- 
               Elsa -- Sallah -- Brody -- Donovan -- registering their 
               different emotions

               Indy proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary.

                                     INDY
                         "The Breath of God... Only the 
                         penitent man will pass. Only the 
                         penitent man will pass..."

               Indy takes a few steps forward.

                                     INDY
                         "The penitent man will pass. The 
                         penitent man..."

               Indy stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have 
               just died.

               Henry looks at Indy. Indy looks at Henry.

                                     HENRY
                              (in a raspy voice)
                         "Only the penitent man will pass. 
                         Only the penitent man will pass."

                                     INDY
                              (quietly to himself)
                         The penitent man will pass. The 
                         penitent... the penitent. The penitent 
                         man...

                                     HENRY
                         The penitent man. The penitent...

               Indy takes a step forward through the cobwebs.

                                     INDY
                         The penitent man is humble before 
                         God.

                                     HENRY
                         Penitent. Penitent...

                                     INDY
                         The penitent man is humble...

               The cobwebs begin to move...

                                     INDY
                         He kneels before God.
                              (to himself; suddenly)
                         Kneel!!

               We hear the awful rush of air -- WHOOSH! Because Indy is in 
               the act of kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his 
               hair flies in his face.

               Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's 
               way and looks up. From his new position he is able to see 
               what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR SHARP TRIPLE 
               PENDULUM.

               Indy gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum 
               has been guarding a SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to 
               the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden wheels turn -- the 
               mechanism controlling the spinning blades. Indy loops a rope 
               around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the 
               blades in mid-swipe.

                                     INDY
                         I'm through!

               ELSA AND DONOVAN

                                     DONOVAN
                         We're through!

               Brody and Sallah smile, relieved.

                                     SALLAH
                              (to Henry)
                         He's all right.

               Henry shakes his head.

                                     HENRY
                         No.

               BACK TO INDY

               Holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now 
               covered in cobwebs.

                                     INDY
                         "The second challenge is the Word of 
                         God. Only in the footsteps of God 
                         will he proceed."
                              (to himself)
                         The Word of God... The Word of...

               Indy pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. 
               Each cobble is engraved with a letter.

                                     INDY
                         "Proceed in the footsteps of the 
                         Word."

               HENRY

               Lifts his head painfully.

                                     HENRY
                         The Word of God...

                                     BRODY
                         No, Henry. Try not to talk.

                                     HENRY
                         The Name of God...

               BACK TO INDY

               As he studies the cobblestones before him.

                                     INDY
                         The Name of God... Jehovah!

               HENRY

               Still lies in Sallah's arms. Brody leans over him.

                                     HENRY
                         But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" 
                         begins with an "I".

               BACK TO INDY

                                     INDY
                         "J".

               Indy takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and 
               Indy falls up to his hip -- his leg stuck through the hold 
               where the stone once was.

               HENRY

               Reacts.

                                     HENRY
                         Oh dear!

               BACK TO INDY

               Who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the Grail Diary 
               in his hand.

                                     INDY
                         In Latin, "Jehovah" starts with an 
                         "I". "I"...

               Now we see each letter on the stones as Indy carefully walks 
               forward. Donovan and Elsa follow in his footsteps.

                                     INDY
                         "E"... "H"... "O"... "V"... "A"...

               Indy sighs with relief and steps forward to:

               THE GREAT ABYSS

               Indy stands in a small opening, just small enough for his 
               shoulders to squeeze through and beyond that a 100 foot drop 
               to the rocks below and 100 feet across, nothing but a rough, 
               stony cliff wall.

               BACK TO INDY

               He can see nowhere to cross. He looks again to the Grail 
               Diary.

                                     INDY
                         "The path of flood. Only in the leap 
                         from the lion's head will he prove 
                         his worth."

               Indy looks around and then he notices that inscribed into 
               the rock above his head is the head of a lion.

                                     INDY
                         Impossible! Nobody can jump this!

               Indy looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it is 
               asking him to do.

               BRODY

               Rushes forward and calls to Indy.

                                     BRODY
                         Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come 
                         quickly!

               BACK TO INDY

                                     INDY
                              (realizing)
                         It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.

               HENRY

               Calls to his son.

                                     HENRY
                         You must believe, boy. you must... 
                         believe.

               We see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he 
               is in midair. We see that he is not going to make it. His 
               hands claw for the opposite wall but he is going to fall 100 
               feet to his death. And then -- he doesn't! He appears to be 
               held up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.

               Indy looks around and down and now he figures it out.

               Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to 
               align with the rocks 100 feet below. It is a perfect forced 
               perspective image of the rocks below with lines from a hundred 
               feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet 
               are stepping.

               It's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved 
               camouflage... in perfect alignment with everything we see 
               below.

               When Indy leans out to the left or right... that's when he 
               sees the perfect alignment shift that betrays the trick. 
               Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and he crosses it like 
               the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.

               Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff 
               and enters a Temple.

               A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this 
               small Temple. Perhaps a hundred or more. Many sizes, many 
               shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all glitter and 
               shine.

               Indy is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And 
               then he realizes that a man is praying at the altar!

               He has his back turned to Indy... but he is dressed as what 
               he is! A GRAIL KNIGHT.

               CLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT

               But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his 
               helmet is down. Perhaps we see his eyes.

               When the Grail Knight sees Indy he gets wearily to his feet 
               and, surprisingly, prepares to give combat... taking up his 
               two-handed broadsword... he comes at Indy, attempting to 
               swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost 
               too much. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, 
               making no attempt to fight back... until the Knight, 
               exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy approaches 
               him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a 
               very ancient man.

                                     KNIGHT
                         I knew you'd come, but my strength 
                         has left me.

                                     INDY
                         Who are you?

                                     KNIGHT
                         The last of three brothers who swore 
                         an oath to find the Grail and to 
                         guard it.

                                     INDY
                         That was seven hundred years ago.

                                     KNIGHT
                         A long time to wait.

               The Grail Knight reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.

                                     KNIGHT
                         You're strangely dressed... for a 
                         knight.

                                     INDY
                         I'm not exactly... a knight. What do 
                         you mean?

                                     KNIGHT
                         I was chosen because I was the bravest 
                         and the most worthy. The honor was 
                         mine until another came to challenge 
                         me to single combat. I pass it to 
                         you who vanquished me.

               The Grail Knight holds his sword out to Indy.

                                     INDY
                              (gulp)
                         Listen, I don't have time to explain, 
                         but --

               At that moment Donovan and Elsa appear. Donovan turns to 
               face the display of cups.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Which one is it?

                                     KNIGHT
                         You must choose.
                              (beat)
                         But choose wisely. For as the True 
                         Grail will bring you life -- the 
                         False Grail will take it from you.

                                     DONOVAN
                         I'm not a historian. I have no idea 
                         what it looks like. Which one is it?

                                     ELSA
                         Let me choose.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Thank you, Doctor.

               Elsa and Indy exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in 
               her true colors.

               Elsa chooses a cup -- a solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.

               Donovan instantly takes it from her.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than 
                         I'd ever imagined. This certainly is 
                         the cup of the King of Kings.

               Donovan rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.

                                     DONOVAN
                         Eternal life!

               Donovan drinks from the goblet.

               Then, Donovan's entire body starts to convulse. His face 
               contorts in agony. He grabs his stomach and turns toward 
               Elsa.

                                     DONOVAN
                         What... is... happening... to... 
                         me...?

               He starts to age -- fast! His hair grows long and gray and 
               brittle. His face sinks. Fingernails curl back on themselves. 
               Milky cataracts coat his eyes.

               Elsa gasps and screams.

                                     DONOVAN
                         What... is... happening...?

               His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his 
               bones until it splits. His skeletal hands reach for Elsa's 
               throat, choking her.

               Indy rushes forward and pushes Donovan away. As he falls he 
               BODY BREAKS INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL.

                                     KNIGHT
                         He chose... poorly.

               Indy studies the array of chalices.

                                     ELSA
                         It would not be made out of gold.

               Indy picks up another cup, a simple earthenware jug.

                                     INDY
                         That's the cup of a carpenter.

               He and Elsa exchange a look.

                                     INDY
                         There's only one way to find out.

               Indy goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with 
               water, then pauses. Indy brings the jug to his lips and takes 
               several large swallows.

               A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and 
               contentment... and we see his wounds begin to heal.

                                     KNIGHT
                         You have chosen wisely. But the Grail 
                         cannot pass beyond the Great Seal. 
                         That is the boundary and the price 
                         of immortality.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BRODY AND SALLAH

               Who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.

               Indy and Elsa come forward with the Grail.

               The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the 
               Grail. They put down their guns and kneel.

               Indy kneels by Henry's side and tilts his head forward and 
               holds the Grail to his lips.

               Henry is too weak to even open his eyes.

               Henry swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the 
               corners of his mouth. Finally Indy pours the water over the 
               wound and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and 
               the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The color returns 
               to Henry's face.

               Henry's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and 
               they light up. Then they shift to Indy's face -- and they 
               light up even more...

               NAZI SOLDIERS run forward. Sallah points a rifle at them.

                                     SALLAH
                         Drop your guns. Please.

               The Nazi Soldiers drop their weapons at their feet and raise 
               their arms in surrender.

                                     INDY
                              (to Henry)
                         Dad, come on. Get to your feet.

               ELSA

               Steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to Indy, her 
               face alight with possession of the Grail.

                                     ELSA
                         We have got it. Come on.

               Elsa steps onto the edge of the Great Seal.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

                                     ELSA
                         It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight 
                         warned us not to take the Grail from 
                         here.

               A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. 
               Dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern. Elsa falls on the 
               Great Seal. The Grail bounces away from her grasp. She reaches 
               for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT OPEN. Elsa 
               slips into the crevasse. She screams.

               Elsa is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost 
               within her reach. As her hands lose their grip, Indy just 
               manages to grab one of them, he himself sliding forward across 
               the slanted floor.

                                     HENRY
                         Junior! Junior!

               With her free hand, Elsa is trying to get the Grail. Indy 
               can't save her unless she gives him her free hand. She has 
               to choose.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give 
                         me your other hand, honey. I can't 
                         hold you.

                                     ELSA
                         I can reach it. I can reach it...

               Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp.

                                     INDY
                         Elsa! Give me your hand. Give me 
                         your other hand!

               Elsa just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has 
               tipped the balance too far -- Indy slides down another yard, 
               Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to her death.

                                     INDY
                              (horrified)
                         Elsa!!

               Now the ledge Indy lies upon begins to break apart. Henry 
               grabs one of his hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail 
               with the other.

                                     HENRY
                         Junior, give me your other hand! I 
                         can't hold on!!

                                     INDY
                         I can get it -- I can almost reach 
                         it, Dad.

               Indy looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him 
               from which nothing can ever be retrieved.

                                     HENRY
                         Indiana. Indiana!!

               Indy snaps his look up to his father. His father has never 
               called him this before.

                                     HENRY
                              (very calmly)
                         ...let it go...

               Indy abandons the Grail and grabs onto Henry with both hands. 
               Henry pulls him up to safety.

               THE GRAIL KNIGHT

               Looks through the falling debris to Indy and Henry. Sallah 
               and Brody rush from the crumbling Temple.

                                     INDY
                         Dad...

               The Grail Knight raises his arm to Henry.

                                     INDY
                         Please, Dad...

               Indy and Henry down the passageway just as a huge stone column 
               tumbles down upon the spot where they stood. The Grail Knight 
               lowers his arm as he watches them leave.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO MOUNTAIN TEMPLE - AFTERNOON

               Indy, Henry, Sallah and Brody emerge from the Mountain Temple 
               through the Grecian Facade.

               From within the Mountain Temple, the ROAR OF WALLS CAVING IN 
               IS HEARD. A cloud of dust and smoke billows out from the 
               entrance.

               Henry turns to Indy.

                                     HENRY
                         Elsa never really believed in the 
                         Grail. She thought she'd found a 
                         prize.

                                     INDY
                         What did you find, Dad?

                                     HENRY
                         Me?... Illumination.

               Henry and Indy mount their horses. Henry turns back to his 
               son.

                                     HENRY
                         What did you find, Junior?

                                     INDY
                         Junior?! Dad...

                                     SALLAH
                         Please... What does it always mean, 
                         this... this "Junior?"

                                     HENRY
                         That's his name. Henry Jones, Junior.

                                     INDY
                         I like Indiana.

                                     HENRY
                         We named the dog Indiana.

                                     BRODY
                         May we go home now, please?

                                     SALLAH
                              (to Indy)
                         The dog!?
                              (laughs)
                         You are named after the dog...

                                     INDY
                              (embarrassed)
                         I've got a lot of fond memories of 
                         that dog.

               A moment passes as they all ready their mounts and Sallah 
               continues to laugh at Indy.

                                     INDY
                         Ready?

                                     HENRY
                         Ready.

                                     BRODY
                         Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the 
                         way!
                              (to his horse)
                         Haaa!

                                     HENRY
                              (to Indy)
                         Got lost in his own museum, huh?

                                     INDY
                         Uh-huh.

                                     HENRY
                         After you, Junior.

                                     INDY
                         Yes, sir!
                              (to his horse)
                         Haaa!

               EXT. THE SECRET CANYON - AFTERNOON

               They THUNDER through the canyon -- whose towering walls 
               threaten to collapse upon them.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO CANYON - SUNSET

               As Brody, Indy, Henry and Sallah ride from the canyon toward 
               the SETTING SUN.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                                                   "INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM"

               FADE IN:

               INT. "THE DRAGON" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

               A Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art 
               Deco pagoda slides open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway 
               down which rows of beautiful women start descending.

               BEGIN MAIN TITLES

               The lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange, 
               haunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir, if 
               it weren't for their sexy, clinging lamé gowns.

               INT. CLUB ENTRANCE

               From the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty 
               face: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kid wearing a 
               beat-up American baseball cap.

               Sneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy 
               gowns and silk suits, heading toward the music in the main 
               ballroom.

               INT. THE BALLROOM

               Short Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub. On 
               the stage, he sees a giant paper-mâché dragon laying curled 
               around the pagoda.

               Now, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke 
               and its enormous jaws open. Out of the dragon's mouth walks 
               the star of the stage show:

               WILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo while 
               the orchestra wails the accompaniment.

               But Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames. He surveys 
               the rich Chinese, American and European revelers. Jewels 
               flash and champagne flows. Short Round finally spots a table 
               of somber-looking Chinese men in suits.

               Short Round chews gum and stares at the men. Then he turns 
               to go. WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches 
               Short Round leave.

               INT. CLUB ENTRANCE

               As Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man 
               in a tuxedo entering the club. Short Round looks up at the 
               man, but we don't see his face.

               Then Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a 
               doorman hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults 
               all the way.

               A maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-
               check girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the 
               ballroom. We notice something incongruous: the man in the 
               tuxedo is wearing work boots caked with mud.

               INT. THE BALLROOM

               The man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing 
               sexily on the stage. Then he looks around and sees the table 
               of somber Chinese men that Short Round spotted earlier.

               As the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes 
               a cigarette from a silver case. He arrives at the table just 
               as the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo --

               And on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge 
               hammer toward an enormous brass gong --

               The man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a 
               cigarette-girl and, as the GONG BOOMS, the match flares to 
               reveal his face for the first time:

               It's INDIANA JONES. Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill. 
               The TITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen:

                                    "SHANGHAI - 1935"

               At the table, the four Chinese man in suits stare coldly at 
               Indiana.

                                     LAO
                         Dr. Jones.

                                     INDIANA
                         Lao She.

                                     LAO
                         Nee chin lie how ma?

               Lao's men laugh and assume that Indy doesn't understand his 
               joke.

                                     INDIANA
                         Wah hung how, nee nah? Wah hwey hung 
                         jing chee jah loo nee kao soo wah 
                         shu shu.

               LAO SHE looks angry and his men's smiles fade.

                                     LAO
                         You never told me you spoke my 
                         language, Dr. Jones.

                                     INDIANA
                         I don't like to show off.

               Indiana takes a seat across the table from Shanghai's 
               notorious crime-lord. Lao is fifty, wealthy enough to now 
               display some fat, but still muscular from his fight to the 
               top of the garbage heap.

                                     LAO
                         For this special occasion, I ordered 
                         champagne and caviar.

               Indiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of 
               him - and stubs his cigarette out in it. The cigarette sizzles 
               and Lao's smiles dies with it.

               There's applause as Willie Scott finishes her song. At the 
               table, Lao stares at Indiana with a strange intensity.

                                     LAO
                         So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found 
                         Nurhachi?

                                     INDIANA
                         Sure, I found him. Then last night I 
                         had a little trouble. Somebody tried 
                         to slit my throat.

               Indiana looks across the table at Lao's son, CHEN, who 
               resembles a bulldog and snarls like one now.

                                     INDIANA
                         It was dark, but I think one of your 
                         sons tried to get Nurhachi without 
                         paying for him.

               Indy stares pointedly at Chen's recently bandaged hand. Chen 
               mutters and stands angrily -- Lao barks a command in Chinese 
               and Chen sits down again.

                                     LAO
                         You have insulted my son.

                                     INDIANA
                         Next time I'll cut off more than his 
                         finger.

                                     LAO
                         Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.

               Lao pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and puts it on the 
               table. Indiana glances at it.

                                     INDIANA
                         As I recall the deal was considerably 
                         more.

               Now a pretty hand slips onto Lao's shoulder and he looks up 
               to see Willie Scott. Lao kisses her hand. Willie is unaware 
               of the explosive mood at the table and she smiles 
               flirtatiously at Indiana.

                                     WILLIE
                              (to Lao)
                         Aren't you going to introduce us?

                                     LAO
                         This is Willie Scott.
                              (watching Indy)
                         And this is Indiana Jones, the famous 
                         archaeologist.

               Willie sits down between Lao and Indy. She takes out a small 
               mirror to check her make-up.

                                     LAO
                         Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me and 
                         is about to deliver him -- now.

               Lao nods across the table and Indy sees KAO KAN, Lao's second 
               son, open his coat and remove a silver-plated pistol. Indiana 
               looks worried. Willie doesn't notice as she fixes her make-
               up and coyly teases Indiana.

                                     WILLIE
                         Well -- I thought archaeologists 
                         were always funny little men searching 
                         for their mummies --
                              (yelping)
                         Aaahhh!

               She looks down terrified at the knife Indy is poking against 
               her ribs.

                                     WILLE
                         I was only kidding, can't you take a 
                         joke -- ?
                              (to Lao)
                         Lao, he's got a knife!

                                     INDIANA
                         Put the gun away, sonny.

               Kao Kan glances at his father. Lao finally nods to his son 
               and he slips the pistol back into his pocket.

                                     INDIANA
                         Now I suggest you pay me what you 
                         promised -- or your girlfriend here 
                         is going to be squealing a new tune.

               The ritzy patrons at the tables nearby are unaware of the 
               tawdry drama quietly unfolding at this table.

               Willie eyes the blade and whimpers. She looks imploringly at 
               Lao and he slowly reaches into his pocket. He puts ten gold 
               coins next to the cash on the table.

               Indy leans forward to look at the gold coins -- so intently 
               that he fails to notice Kao Kan spilling some powder into 
               Indy's champagne glass!

                                     INDIANA
                         Try again Lao -- the deal was more.

               The knife pokes Willie and she whimpers again. Lao reaches 
               into another pocket and brings out a folded piece of rice 
               paper -- he opens it and a large diamond and ruby spill out 
               onto the table.

                                     INDIANA
                         Bingo... you see, Lao, with a bit of 
                         persuasion, even you can be an honest 
                         fellow.

               Indy smiles and jabs the knife into the middle of the table. 
               Then he lifts his champagne glass in a toast to Lao -- who 
               watches expectantly as Indiana moves the glass toward his 
               lips --

               Suddenly Willie stands angrily, jostling Indy's arm so that 
               he doesn't drink his champagne.

                                     WILLIE
                         Look at this! He put a hole in my 
                         dress from Paris!

               Lao sees Indy put his champagne glass down and he snarls at 
               Willie --

                                     LAO
                         Sit down!

               Willie quickly obeys. Lao forces a smile at Indy and lifts 
               his glass to seal the deal --

                                     LAO
                         To your health, Dr. Jones.

               Lao sips hs champagne and watches hopefully as Indy picks up 
               his glass and this time Indy does drink the champagne. Then 
               he reaches for the cash --

               But Chen grins and puts a silver snuff bottle next to the 
               cash, gold and jewels -- he tips the little bottle over and 
               some white powder spills out of it --

                                     INDIANA
                         What's that?

                                     LAO
                         A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. 
                         You just drank the rest of it.

               Indiana examines his champagne glass and sees a residue at 
               the bottom of it. He swallows and feels sick, wondering it 
               it's fear or the poison already taking effect.

                                     LAO
                         There is an antidote for this poison. 
                         You give me Nurhachi -- I give you 
                         the antidote.

               Indiana is sweating. Willie looks at him and sees Indy's 
               hand shaking.

                                     LAO
                         The poison works fast, Dr. Jones. 
                         Where is Nurhachi?

               Indiana finally reaches into his pocket. Next to the cash, 
               gold, jewels and poison, Indiana sets down a beautiful small 
               box. Lao and his men stare hypnotically at the exquisite 
               gold and enamel box.

                                     WILLIE
                              (nervously)
                         This Nurhachi's a very small guy.

               Nobody pays any attention to her as Lao reaches for the box.

                                     INDIANA
                         Inside are the remains of Nurhachi -- 
                         the first Emperor of the Manchu 
                         Dynasty.

               Lao opens the box carefully and stares reverently at the 
               grey powder inside.

                                     INDIANA
                         Now what about the antidote, Lao.

                                     LAO
                              (holding the box)
                         At last I have the ashes of my sacred 
                         ancestor!

                                     WILLIE
                         So, what's the big deal? Let me see 
                         it --

               Willie grabs Lao's arm and some of the precious ashes spill 
               out of the gold box. Stunned by this desecration of his 
               ancestor, Lao grabs Willie by the wrist and twists her arm --

                                     LAO
                         You fool!

                                     WILLIE
                         Ow, you're hurting me, you miserable 
                         little hood!

                                     INDIANA
                         Let go of her, Lao. And give me the 
                         antidote.

               Lao just laughs evilly -- until a waiter moves up behind Lao 
               and the crimelord suddenly stiffens. He lets go of Willie's 
               wrist and raises his hands off the table. Chen stops 
               collecting the money and jewels.

               Kao Kan tenses and Indy smiles at Wu Han, the Chinese waiter 
               with the scar, who is standing behind Lao. Wu Han has a towel 
               over his hand-under it, he has a pistol pressed against Lao's 
               spine.

                                     INDIANA
                              (smiling at Wu Han)
                         I like the service here.

                                     WILLIE
                              (puzzled)
                         Hey, he's not a waiter...

                                     INDIANA
                         No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought 
                         along.
                              (to Lao)
                         So, the game's not over. Put the 
                         antidote on the table, Lao.

               Lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass 
               vial of liquid next to the cash, gold, jewels, poison and 
               sacred box. Indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial 
               of antidote -- then he hears a muffled report! And another!

               Wu Han groans and sways. Indy starts to stand but Chen 
               immediately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that 
               he used to kill Wu Han -- Indy sees it pointed at him now 
               and he remains in his seat.

               Kao Kan stands and grabs Wu Han, easing the phony waiter 
               into the chair he just vacated. The muffled shooting hasn't 
               attracted any attention. The nightclub activity continues an 
               Indy speaks emotionally to his dying friend.

                                     INDIANA
                         Wu Han -- listen to me -- I'm going 
                         to get you out of here.

               In pain, Wu Han looks at Indy and struggles to speak --

                                     WU HAN
                         Not this time, my friend...
                              (smiling bravely)
                         I followed you on many adventures -- 
                         but into the great Unknown Mystery, 
                         I go first, Indy...

               Wu Han dies and slumps forward. Indiana is shattered by the 
               death of his old friend.

                                     LAO
                         Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you will 
                         soon join him.

               Indy's gaze shifts from his dead friend to Lao's sneering 
               face. Then Indy sees the murderous Chen giggling perversely. 
               Indy's anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut 
               and his vision of Chen's ugly face blurs into a double image --

               Indy stands up unsteadily. Chen assumes he's about to keel 
               over from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a 
               real waiter at another table. The waiter holds a long skewer 
               of roasted pigeons that he's just set afire --

               Indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambeé and hurls is across 
               the table! Chen fires and misses -- and screams as the skewer 
               stabs into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front 
               of his horrified face!

               This the other tables definitely notice. There are screams 
               and all hell breaks loose. Indiana shoves past Willie and 
               reaches for the vial on the table --

                                     INDIANA
                         The antidote -- !

               But he's grabbed from behind by Kao Kan. Indy elbows the 
               punk, reaches back and grabs his head -- and somersaults Kao 
               Kan onto the table!

               As number two son crashes into the table, the impact sends 
               the Emperor Nurhachi's ashes billowing into Lao's stricken 
               face!

               Indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across 
               the table -- and falling!

               Indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits 
               the floor -- then Indy's hand is brutally stomped on by one 
               of Lao's henchmen and the vial rolls away.

               Indiana angrily raises his head, smashing it up into the 
               henchman's groin -- the man howls like a banshee and hobbles 
               away.

               Meanwhile, Willie watches Lao grabbing for cash from the 
               table. Willie lunges past the pigeon-skewered Chen to snatch 
               the jewels, but unfortunately Kao Kan knocks them off the 
               table as he leaps to attack Indy.

               Indiana scrambles on his hands and knees after the rolling 
               vial. People keep kicking it -- he almost has it when Willie 
               runs into him, trips and lands on her back.

                                     INDIANA
                         Look out, damn it, I need that 
                         antidote!

                                     WILLIE
                         Who cares? Where's that diamond!

               Gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different 
               directions. Indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons 
               and slides behind a water-spewing fountain. Water kicks up 
               as Indy is shot at by Lao and his henchmen.

               Indy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins 
               across the marble floor -- feeling the poison, Indy shakes 
               his head groggily and splashes water on his face.

               Meanwhile, Willie is chasing her diamond, shoving through 
               the panicked crowd. She spots the diamond! Another elegantly 
               dresses woman is bending to pick it up --

                                     WILLIE
                              (acidly polite)
                         Excuse me, but I believe that's my 
                         diamond!

               Willie smiles and suddenly kicks the woman in the butt! Willie 
               reaches to get the diamond but not before the other woman 
               tackles her.

               Behind the fountain, Indiana makes a break -- he runs and 
               dives on top of a serving cart. The wheeled cart hurtles 
               toward an unsuspecting gunman, crashes into him from behind 
               and sends him flying head first into a row of ice buckets.

               Nearby, Willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for 
               the elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across 
               the floor -- which camouflages the diamond!

                                     WILLIE
                         Aw nuts!

               Searching desperately for the jewel, Willie sees the vial of 
               antidote spinning across the floor -- as it slides by, she 
               grabs it.

                                     INDIANA (O.S.)
                         Hey, doll! Don't move!

               She sees Indy speeding by atop the serving cart. Lao and his 
               gunmen rush out to block the way. Indy rolls off the cart 
               and slides behind a potted palm as Lao's men open fire again.

                                     INDIANA
                              (shouting to Willie)
                         Hey, don't go away! I need that!

               Willie smiles meanly as she slips the vial down the front of 
               her dress, thumbs her nose at Indiana and walks away.

                                     INDIANA
                         If I wasn't dying, I'd kill her...

               Hiding behind the palm tree, Indiana looks around and spots 
               a giant statue at the side of the stage. Indy makes a break 
               for it.

               As the gunmen open fire, Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps 
               onto a table -- and leaps onto the stage. He grabs the golden 
               broad-sword from the Chinese warrior statue!

               As bullets smash into the statue, Indiana hides behind it. 
               Then he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the 
               enormous brass gong.

               The crimson cord holding the gong is SLASHED! Indy slings 
               the sword at his assailants and gives the three-meter-high 
               gong a helpful shove --

               The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble 
               steps. Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls 
               across the dance floor.

               Using the gong as an enormous shield, Indy evades the gunfire 
               exploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as 
               Indy runs behind it.

               Ahead, Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something 
               and turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong 
               bearing down on her!

               Willie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind 
               the gong with him --

               Lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying 
               to get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come 
               into the club now and start firing machine guns!

               As bullets clang against the gong, Indiana and Willie run 
               behind it. Willie hollers as they head directly for a 
               towering, floor-to-ceiling window!

               Indiana grabs Willie around the waist and, after the huge 
               gong crashes through the stained-glass window, they both fly 
               after it!

               EXT. "THE DRAGON" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

               In a shower of sparkling glass, the enormous gong sails out 
               and crashes down a sloping green-tiled roof. Indiana Jones 
               and Willie Scott hurtle into the night air after it!

               The gong rolls down the roof and they hit the tiles behind 
               it, Indiana holding onto Willie as they roll one-over-the-
               other toward the edge -- Willie screams as they fall into 
               thin air!

               Their entwined bodies plummet three stories: ripping through 
               a third-floor awning, crashing through an old man's mattress 
               on a second-floor balcony --

               Finally they smash through the convertible top of a parked 
               Duesenberg and fall into the back seat!

               INT. THE DUESENBERG

               Willie sits up wide-eyed, speechless and amazed to be alive. 
               Then she sees an equally astonished Short Round looking at 
               them from the front seat.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!

                                     INDIANA
                         Step on it, Short Round!

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your 
                         potatoes!

               The twelve-year-old Chinese kid turns his baseball cap bill-
               backwards and steps on the gas! The tires squeal as the car 
               roars off --

                                     WILLIE
                         For crying out loud, a kid's driving 
                         the car?!

                                     INDIANA
                         Relax, I've been giving him lessons.

               EXT. THE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

               The Duesenberg races past the entrance to the nightclub as 
               Lao and his man rush out and jump into two black sedans. The 
               sedans screech off in pursuit of the Duesenberg.

               INT. THE DUESENBERG

               As Short Round eagerly swerves around a corner, Willie holds 
               on for dear life. Indiana suddenly puts his hand down the 
               front of Willie's dress --

                                     WILLIE
                         Listen, we just met for crissake! 
                         I'm not that kind of girl!

                                     INDIANA
                         Don't get your hopes up -- where's 
                         the antidote?

               Indiana withdraws his hand, having finally found the vial. 
               He opens is quickly, tips the vial to his lips and grimaces 
               as he swallows the stuff.

                                     WILLIE
                         You don't look very good.

                                     INDIANA
                         Poison never agrees with me.
                              (shouting forward)
                         Pull a right, Short Round, and head 
                         for the Wang Poo bridge!

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Check! Gotcha!

               As the car accelerates, Indy peers out the back window at 
               their pursuers. Willie notices her reflection in the side 
               window --

                                     WILLIE
                         Look at what you've done to me! I'm 
                         a mess! My lipstick's smeared, I 
                         broke two nails, I've got an awful 
                         run in my stocking!

               Gunfire suddenly explodes, bullets whizz through the canvas 
               top and the rear window shatters and sprays glass! Willie 
               ducks and cringes terrified in the corner --

                                     INDIANA
                         Somehow I think you've got bigger 
                         problems.

               Indy grabs his shoulder bag and pulls a pistol out of it. He 
               pokes the gun through the broken window and starts firing 
               back at their pursuers -- then he turns and looks ahead.

                                     INDIANA
                         There, Shorty! Through the tunnel!

               Through the windows we see the car racing into a tunnel. 
               Lights from the pursuing cars flash through the rear window 
               and gunfire echoes in the tunnel.

                                     WILLIE
                         What're we going to do?! Where're we 
                         going?!

                                     INDIANA
                         The airport... No, look out, Short 
                         Round! Left, left!

               Indy reaches over the front seat and helps Short Round 
               navigate.

               EXT. A SHANGHAI SQUARE - NIGHT

               The Duesenberg tears around the square, followed by Lao's 
               two sedans. People on the street dive for cover -- coolies 
               pulling rickshaws go into hyper-jog -- lanterns spanning the 
               street crash down and are dragged behind the Duesenberg. 
               Bullets explode and amazed prostitutes watch the cars zoom 
               past.

               INT. THE DUESENBERG - NIGHT

               The chaotic chase continues -- bullets whine past and the 
               shredded convertible top whips in the wind.

                                     INDIANA
                              (shouting)
                         You got the tickets, Short Round?

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me 
                         and Wu Han --

               Shorty throws an envelope back and Indy looks at the three 
               tickets.

                                     INDIANA
                              (sadly)
                         Wu Han's not coming, Shorty.

               Unaware of what happened at the club, Short Round thinks a 
               moment.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Don't worry, Indy. Short Round number 
                         one bodyguard now!

               Willie reaches for the extra ticket.

                                     WILLIE
                         I'll take the extra ticket.
                              (grabbing it from 
                              Indy)
                         Where's this plane going anyway?

                                     INDIANA
                         Siam.

                                     WILLIE
                         Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...

               EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Leaving behind the squalid port, the Duesenberg flies along 
               the highway through the trees. In a moment, Lao's two sedans 
               race by.

               EXT. NANG TAO AIRFIELD - NIGHT

               The Duesenberg swings around a curve and skids through gravel 
               toward the airfield. In the distance there is a small terminal 
               but Short Round wheels the car toward the cargo area --

               A two-engine passenger plane is revving its motors and the 
               last passengers are boarding. The Duesenberg squeals to a 
               stop and Indy jumps out with Willie and Short Round right on 
               his heels.

               A contingent of airport Military Police move to bar their 
               way until WEBER, a heavy-set Englishman, runs up puffing and 
               shouting.

                                     WEBER
                         No, no, they're all right! Let them 
                         through please.

                                     INDIANA
                         Thanks, Weber.

                                     WEBER
                         Dr. Jones, this is positively the 
                         last time our airline can hold a 
                         plane for you. Now you must hurry!

               While Short Round grabs a small bag out of the car, Weber 
               and a stewardess take their tickets and rush them all toward 
               the airplane.

               Meanwhile, the two sedans skid to a stop and Lao and his son 
               Kao Kan jumps out with their henchmen. The puzzled military 
               police advance on them suspiciously --

               Realizing he's outnumbered, Lao instructs his men to stay 
               back and to put away their weapons.

               EXT. THE AIRPLANE

               Willie and Short Round charge up the ladder and onto the 
               plane. Indy pauses at the top of the steps to give Lao a 
               cocky farewell salute. Indy boards the plane and the co-pilot 
               slams the door.

               EXT. THE AIRFIELD

               The plane starts taxiing. By the cars, Lao is buffeted by 
               the prop wash as he angrily watches the plane roll away. 
               Behind Lao, his son, Kao Kan, stares at the plane taking off -- 
               a look on Kao Kan's face indicates that he hasn't given up 
               yet...

               The plane lifts off the airfield, silhouetted against the 
               clouds and the first light of dawn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE DKY - MORNING

               The sun flashes above the horizon and the plane banks through 
               white billowing clouds as it heads west.

               INT. THE PLANE

               A door opens at the rear of the plane and Indiana Jones exits 
               wearing more familiar attire: a beat-up leather jacket over 
               a khaki shirt and a snap-brim hat. He passes a dozen 
               passengers as he moves up the aisle carrying his rolled-up 
               tuxedo.

               In the first row, Willie is busy fixing her make-up. Shorty 
               sits in the seat across the aisle from her. Indy comes up 
               and drops his tuxedo onto the floor.

               Willie sees him hook his coiled bullwhip over a coat-peg.

                                     WILLIE
                         So, what're you supposed to be, a 
                         lion tamer?

                                     INDIANA
                         Since I was nice enough to let you 
                         tag along, why don't you give your 
                         mouth a rest? Okay, doll?

               Indy pats her leg -- she removes his hand and reaches down 
               and picks up his tuxedo coat. She slips it on.

                                     WILLIE
                         I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag 
                         along? From the minute you walked 
                         into that nightclub, you haven't 
                         been able to keep your eyes off me.

                                     INDIANA
                         Oh yeah?

               He smiles and tips his hat down over his eyes to go to 
               sleep...

               INT. THE COCKPIT

               At the same moment, the Chinese co-pilot tips his hat up off 
               his eyes -- and looks scared to death! He exclaims in Chinese --

                                     CO-PILOT
                              (subtitled)
                         Good lord!

               He and the pilot see two biplanes materialize out of the 
               clouds and dive directly toward them! Suddenly, machine 
               gunfire erupts!

                                     PILOT
                              (subtitled)
                         Dive for the clouds! Dive!

               EXT. THE SKY - DAY

               The DC-3 banks into the clouds as the two biplanes attack. 
               In the back seat of the first biplane, we see Kao Kan watching 
               the DC-3 like a hawk about to bring down a sparrow.

               INT. THE COCKPIT

               The biplanes swoop past both sides of the plane and bursts 
               of gunfire rip along the fuselage.

                                     CO-PILOT
                              (subtitled)
                         They hit a fuel line!

                                     PILOT
                              (subtitled)
                         Reduce speed -- get everyone out of 
                         the plane!

               INT. THE PASSENGER CABIN

               As the air battle rages, the passengers are tossed about and 
               some start screaming. Short Round peers out a window.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Lao send planes to kill Indy!

               Willie shakes Indy's arm but he continues snoring under his 
               hat.

                                     WILLIE
                         Wake up! It's the drug he drank to 
                         stop the poison --

               The cockpit door bursts open and the Chinese co-pilot exits 
               to make an announcement -- he smiles and speaks in CHINESE, 
               then he smiles and speaks in FRENCH --

               Willie looks lost until the Chinese co-pilot smiles again 
               and speaks in ENGLISH --

                                     CO-PILOT
                         Please to remain calm. We start 
                         passing out parachutes now --

               The co-pilot hurries toward the rear. Willie looks petrified 
               as a stewardess rushes up and hands her a parachute.

                                     WILLIE
                         You got to be kidding! No! No, I 
                         can't!

               The pilot hurries out of the cockpit and grabs his parachute 
               as he heads toward the back.

                                     WILLIE
                         Wait -- who's flying the plane?!

               She opens the door to the cockpit --

                                     WILLIE
                         Nobody's flying the plane...

               EXT. THE SKY - DAY

               The DC-3 smokes through the clouds. Passengers are bailing 
               out -- parachutes billowing. As one of the fighters swoops 
               through the parachutes, Kao Kan searches the faces -- then 
               he points at the DC-3.

                                     KAO KAN
                              (into the radio)
                         Jones! Indiana Jones!

               The two planes roar off and start strafing the DC-3 again.

               INT. THE PASSENGER CABIN

               The co-pilot has a parachute on and is trying to get Short 
               Round into one.

                                     CO-PILOT
                         Put it on! What's wrong with you? 
                         You've got to jump!

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         No, can't leave Indy!

               Short Round suddenly butts the co-pilot in the stomach with 
               his head. The co-pilot yells and falls out the door. Short 
               Round sees the co-pilot's parachute billow. Then Willie rushes 
               up.

                                     WILLIE
                         Give me that parachute, I changed my 
                         mind --

               She grabs the parachute and starts to fight Shorty over it --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         No, this last one! It's for Indy!

               They scuffle until the parachute skids across the floor. 
               Short Round jumps for it -- the parachute falls out the door 
               and Short Round starts to fall out after it!

               Willie grabs him by the seat of his pants and hauls him back 
               from the abyss!

               EXT. THE SKY - DAY

               The fighters peel off toward the DC-3 with their guns flaming 
               in another attack.

               INT. THE PASSENGER CABIN

               Short Round tries to wake Indy again. Finally, Shorty grabs 
               Indy's bag, pulls his holster out of it and runs toward the 
               back.

               Indy continues to sleep -- until bullets smash the window by 
               his head and a fire extinguisher is hit and starts spraying 
               into Indy's face.

               He finally awakens and jumps up. He looks around is disbelief 
               at the battle-torn, nearly-empty airplane.

                                     INDIANA
                              (groggily)
                         We there yet?

               Indiana sees Shorty shooting his pistol out the side door as 
               the planes swoop by again. Out of ammo, Shorty throws the 
               gun angrily at the passing plane.

               Indiana picks up his whip and attaches it to his belt as 
               Willie runs over to him.

                                     WILLIE
                         There's nobody flying the plane!

               INT. THE COCKPIT

               The door flies open and Indy rushes in with Willie behind 
               him. Indy appraises the situation quickly and jumps into the 
               pilot's seat with total confidence --

                                     WILLIE
                         You know how to fly?

               Indy surveys the control panels, the myriad of dials and 
               switches --

                                     INDIANA
                         No.
                              (hopefully)
                         Do you?

               INT. THE PASSENGER CABIN

               Willie runs screaming out of the cockpit, her last hope 
               shattered. Shorty is pulling something out of the cargo 
               compartment -- he's found a machine gun and sets it up on a 
               short tripod.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Come here, lady, hold this and shut 
                         up please!

               He pulls Willie down to the floor and shoves her the 
               ammunition belt that's draped toward the gun. Then Shorty 
               jumps behind the machine gun --

               As the first fighter appears off their side, Short Round 
               blasts out the open door! The machine gun explodes to life, 
               chewing bullets, smoking and spitting shells at Willie --

               Willie hollers terrified but manages to feed the ammo belt 
               as Short Round sights the blazing machine gun -- suddenly he 
               shoots!

               Willie sees the fighter hit -- it smokes and veers away -- 
               and then EXPLODES!

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         I get it!

                                     WILLIE
                         You got it!

               The second plane swoops down and Short Round blasts away. 
               This time as he swivels the gun, he misses and hits one of 
               the DC-3's own engines and it explodes!

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Oh oh -- big mistake!

               INT. THE COCKPIT

               Trying to figure out the controls, Indy looks up to see their 
               engine explode into flames --

                                     INDIANA
                              (angrily)
                         Short Round, what in the hell are 
                         you doing?

               Suddenly the DC-3 emerges out of a cloud and Indy sees they 
               are headed directly for a mountain! He pulls back hard on 
               the controls as a rocky peak looms lethally in front of them.

               EXT. THE SKY - DAY

               The DC-3 lifts at the last second and smashes some snow off 
               the uppermost pinnacle as it clears the mountain by inches!

               Kao Kan's fighter is glued to the DC-3's tail and continues 
               to strafe -- but the fighter pilot pulls up too late -- and 
               the fighter explodes as it hits the peak of the mountain!

               INT. THE PASSENGER CABIN

               Indy rushes out of the smoking cockpit to find Willie and 
               Short Round crawling out from under the debris that's fallen 
               on them. Then Indy spots something in the wreckage --

               He pulls at some yellow canvas and Willie sees as sign: 
               "EMERGENCY LIFE RAFT". Indy drags the folded canvas over to 
               the open door.

                                     WILLIE
                         Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're 
                         not sinking, we're crashing!

                                     INDIANA
                         Get over here, damn it! Short Round, 
                         come on, grab onto me tight!

               Willie sees Short Round rush over to Indiana and grab him 
               around the waist from behind. Willie finally jumps up and 
               runs over --

                                     WILLIE
                         Wait for me!

               She throws her arms around Indy's neck so that she and Shorty 
               are both hugging him from behind. Indy clutches the folded 
               lift raft in front of him and surveys the mountainside rushing 
               close beneath the sinking airplane --

               Finally, an instant before the plane will hit, Indy dives 
               and pulls the inflation cord!

               EXT. THE SKY

               As the smoking DC-3 screams out of control toward the 
               mountain, skimming the rocky snow-covered slopes, we see the 
               life raft spilling out the open door --

               The raft pops into its full shape, acting now as a spoiler, 
               soaring against the rushing wind and finally crashing and 
               bouncing against the snowy mountainside.

               In the distance, we see the DC-3 finally kiss the earth and 
               explode in a cloud of flame against a rocky escarpment -- 
               metal and earth mushrooming in a million directions!

               EXT. THE MOUNTAINSIDE

               As the raft rockets down the snow, Indiana clutches the front 
               and Willie and Short Round hold on for dear life on either 
               side of him.

               The raft plummets down the mountain, crossing the timber-
               line and entering a forest. Bouncing over a snow-hidden log, 
               the raft shoots directly for a tree --

               Indiana pulls on the perimeter rope, rolls on his side and 
               manages to swerve the raft so it caroms off the snow-drifted 
               side of the tree trunk.

               Continuing its downhill run, the raft smashes across a small 
               steam, sending silvery water spraying.

               As the raft skids below the snow-level, it starts bouncing 
               over rocky ground and its three passengers' teeth start 
               chattering.

               EXT. A BLUFF

               The yellow raft crashes through a tangle of bushes and then 
               plummets toward a bluff! The raft goes airborne over a small 
               bluff and lands with a splash in a slow-moving river.

               EXT. THE RIVER

               The life raft drifts down the river and Indy looks around 
               and smiles cockily at Willie and Short Round --

               Their faces don't show gratitude, but horror -- Indy hears 
               something and turns to see:

               EXT. WHITE WATER RAPIDS

               The raft is heading directly toward a surging stretch of 
               treacherous rapids. Indiana looks less cocky as he and Willie 
               and Short Round hold on again for dear life!

               The raft plunges into the roaring torrent, bouncing over 
               rock-swollen waves, twisting and spinning through narrow 
               gaps. The three helpless passengers are drenched in the 
               thundering cascades of white water.

               Willie is hollering, Short Round hangs on wide-eyed and even 
               Indy looks terrified as the raft crashes down the rapids. 
               Finally, after one heart-stopping bounce, the raft seems to 
               slow.

               EXT. RIVER CLEARING

               The raft drifts out of the main part of the river and glides 
               toward a clearing. Its three soaked and bedraggled passengers 
               lie motionless in the bottom.

               Indy's hand drags alongside the raft, his fingers leaving a 
               trail in the almost still water. Battered and exhausted, but 
               always Indy's "bodyguard", Shorty looks over at him worriedly --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy?

                                     INDIANA
                         Okay, Shorty.

               Indy looks over at Willie who is moaning.

                                     INDIANA
                         You all right?

                                     WILLIE
                         No... I'm not cut out for the kind 
                         of life you lead.
                              (moaning)
                         Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where 
                         are we anyway?

               The raft floats to a gentle stop -- we see it nudge against 
               a pair of dark feet. Indy squints up into the sun and sees 
               something.

                                     INDIANA
                         India...

                                     WILLIE
                         Holy cow -- India? How do you know 
                         we're in --

               She rolls over and yelps as she looks up at the bizarre, 
               painted face of a SHAMAN. Silhouetted against the blazing 
               sun, the skinny little old man in a loincloth stares down at 
               them in the raft.

               An eerie wind rises and howls. The old man places his palms 
               together and moves his hands up to touch his forehead. Willie 
               and Short Round watch mystified as Indiana returns the old 
               shaman's silent greeting.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY

               Indy and Short Round follow the shaman and four peasants 
               down a rutted path through barren rolling hills. Willie is 
               out of her milieu, stumbling along this forlorn landscape in 
               high heels, tuxedo jacket and disheveled lamé gown.

               She hears the old shaman talking to Indy and catches up with 
               them to find out what's going on.

                                     WILLIE
                              (to Indiana)
                         What'd he say?

                                     INDIANA
                         He told me they knew I was coming 
                         here.

                                     WILLIE
                         What do you mean -- how?

                                     INDIANA
                         The old man saw it in a dream.

                                     WILLIE
                         Dream -- nightmare is more like it.

                                     INDIANA
                         He said that's whey they were at 
                         river -- they were waiting for the 
                         plane to fall down.

               He looks at her bewildered face and smiles faintly. As they 
               walk, a hot wind swirls dust around them, a wind slowly 
               ravaging what soil is left in this terribly blighted region.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MAYAPORE - DAY

               At the base of the hills, Mayapore village does nothing to 
               relieve the awful sense of devastation. A desolate road runs 
               through the village, along which groups of pitifully poor 
               villagers stare at the strangers being brought in.

               Hopeless women lift buckets from a dry well -- finding only 
               sand. Skinny miserable dogs skulk between the decrepit village 
               huts, eyed by the patient vultures lurking in scraggly trees.

               Indiana notices the wretched peasants staring at Short Round, 
               some of them pointing at him, a few haggard women shedding 
               tears down their wrinkled faces as the little Chinese boy 
               passes.

               There is no sign of children in the village and Short Round 
               grows frightened by the odd attention. He moves closer to 
               Indy as they pass the devastated population.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MAYAPORE VILLAGE - AFTER SUNSET

               Black clouds clot across the blood-red sky as darkness falls. 
               Indiana, Willie and Short Round sit tensely on a shabby rug. 
               Above their heads, there is a thatched roof, but there are 
               no walls.

               The dying sunset silhouettes them and the half-dozen elders 
               seated in the dirt around them. A grey-haired man, the village 
               CHIEFTAIN, gives quiet commands to the women who scuttle in 
               and set wooden plates in front of the three visitors. No 
               plates are places in front of the elders.

                                     WILLIE
                              (quietly to Indy)
                         I hope this means we're going to get 
                         some dinner.

               Indiana sees the painted shaman, who sits next to the 
               chieftain, watching Willie. The women bring in a bowl from 
               which they scoop tiny portions of grey gruel onto three 
               plates.

               To this the women add a few grains of yellowed rice and a 
               withered, molding piece of fruit. Willie looks aghast at the 
               unappetizing combination.

                                     WILLIE
                              (quietly)
                         God, I am starving, but I can't eat 
                         this...

                                     INDIANA
                         That's more food than these people 
                         eat in a week.
                              (pointedly)
                         They're starving, too...

               Willie looks around at the emaciated faces and feels like 
               crawling into a hole.

                                     WILLIE
                         I'm sorry, I -- here, please.

               She picks up her plate and gently hands it back to the women. 
               The chieftain finally speaks to them --

                                     CHIEFTAIN
                         You will rest here before you go on.

                                     INDIANA
                         We'd appreciate that. This was an 
                         unexpected detour. We'll have to go 
                         to Delhi now and find a flight west.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                              (smiling)
                         Indy is taking me to America.

               All eyes are on Short Round. Puzzled by this strange 
               attention, Shorty's smile fades nervously.

                                     INDIANA
                         I'm a professor. I have to return to 
                         the university. Can you give us a 
                         guide to take us to Delhi?

               The chieftain indicates a young villager sitting near them.

                                     CHIEFTAIN
                         Sanju will guide you.

                                     INDIANA
                         Thank you.

               The old shaman speaks now for the first time.

                                     SHAMAN
                         On the way to Delhi, you will stop 
                         at Pankot.

                                     INDIANA
                              (puzzled)
                         Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.

                                     SHAMAN
                         You will go to palace there.

                                     INDIANA
                         Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted 
                         since the Mutiny of 1857?

                                     SHAMAN
                              (darkly)
                         No. Now there is new Maharajah -- 
                         and palace is powerful again.

               The shaman looks around at his unfortunate people.

                                     SHAMAN
                         It is Pankot Palace that kills my 
                         village.

                                     INDIANA
                         I don't understand. What's happened 
                         here?

                                     SHAMAN
                         The evil starts in Pankot. Then like 
                         monsoon, it moves darkness over all 
                         country.

                                     INDIANA
                         What evil?

                                     SHAMAN
                         They came from Palace and took 
                         sivalinga from out village.

               Willie looks over at Indiana --

                                     WILLIE
                         Took what?

                                     INDIANA
                         It's a sacred stone in a shine that's 
                         supposed to protect a village.

                                     SHAMAN
                         It is why Krishna brought you here.

                                     INDIANA
                              (politely firm)
                         Nobody brought us here. Our plane 
                         crashed. We were shot down by --

                                     SHAMAN
                              (interrupting)
                         No. We pray to Krishna to help us 
                         find the stone. It was Krishna who 
                         made you fall from sky -- so you can 
                         got to Pankot Palace. To find 
                         sivalinga -- and bring back to us.

               Indy's about to object -- then he looks at the sad chieftain, 
               the elders and peasants who are watching him helplessly. And 
               he sees again the dark steady eyes of the old shaman.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MAYAPORE VILLAGE - NIGHT

               Torches flare eerily and dogs howl as the peasants accompany 
               the shaman, elders and three visitors out of the edge of the 
               dark village. Short Round walks beside Indy.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy, they make our plane crash? To 
                         get you here?

                                     INDIANA
                         It's just superstition, Shorty. Like 
                         a ghost story.

               Short Round looks plenty scared as they all stop walking. 
               The shaman motions and the men with torches circle around a 
               pile of rocks to illuminate them. The shaman makes a gesture 
               of devotion to the primitive shrine and Indy speaks to the 
               village chieftain.

                                     CHIEFTAIN
                         Yes.

               Indiana seems skeptical as he kneels to study the shrine. On 
               top of the pile of rocks, there is a carved niche. The niche 
               is empty but an indentation indicates the conical shape of 
               the stone that was stolen.

                                     INDIANA
                         Was the stone very smooth?
                              (he sees the chieftain 
                              nod)
                         It was probably brought here from a 
                         sacred river.

                                     SHAMAN
                              (joining Indy and the 
                              chieftain)
                         Long ago -- before my father's father.

                                     INDIANA
                         And it had three lines painted across 
                         it?
                              (seeing the shaman 
                              nod)
                         The lines represent the three levels 
                         of the universe. I've seen stones 
                         like the one you lost.

               Indy stands slowly. Willie is beside him looking at the 
               shrine.

                                     WILLIE
                         I don't understand how losing one 
                         rock could destroy this village.
                              (whispering to Indy)
                         Is it really powerful?

               Indy gives a doubtful smile. He turns again to the old shaman.

                                     INDIANA
                         But why would the Maharajah take 
                         this sacred stone?

                                     SHAMAN
                         They say we must pray to their evil 
                         god. We say we will not.

               The old shaman looks off and fights the tears in his eyes as 
               he starts speaking in Hindi.

                                     INDIANA
                              (translating)
                         He says that when the sacred stone 
                         was taken the village wells dried up 
                         first and then the river stopped.

               Indy turns and asks the shaman a question in Hindi. The shaman 
               answers in Hindi.

                                     INDIANA
                              (translating)
                         He says their crops died and then 
                         the animals died.

               The shaman walks to the edge of the torchlight and looks out 
               into the darkness as he continues speaking emotionally in 
               Hindi --

                                     INDIANA
                              (translating)
                         And then they took their children.

                                     WILLIE
                         Their children?

               She looks at Short Round and finally understands the sorrowful 
               faces always watching him. Indy asks another question in 
               Hindi and the shaman continues his story --

                                     INDIANA
                              (translating)
                         He says one night there was a fire 
                         in the fields. The men went to fight 
                         it. When they came back, they heard 
                         the women crying in the darkness. 
                         And the children were gone.

               The shaman walks slowly toward Indiana.

                                     SHAMAN
                         You will find them when you find 
                         sivlalinga.

                                     INDIANA
                         I'm sorry, I don't know how I can 
                         help you here.

               The shaman and the chieftain stare and Indiana, refusing to 
               accept that.

                                     INDIANA
                         The English authorities who control 
                         this area are the only ones who can 
                         help you.

                                     CHIEFTAIN
                         They do not listen.

                                     INDIANA
                         I have friends in Delhi and I will 
                         make sure they investigate this...

                                     SHAMAN
                         No, you will got to Pankot...

               The old man speaks again in his own tongue and Indy looks 
               disturbed.

                                     WILLIE
                         What'd he say now?

                                     INDIANA
                         It was destined that I came here -- 
                         and the future cannot be changed...

               Indy looks at the shaman and the torchlight reflected in his 
               eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MAYAPORE - NIGHT

               Suddenly we're rushing headlong down a dark dirt path seen 
               from the POV of somebody running in terror. We hear heavy 
               breathing -- above we see the scraggly trees blowing against 
               the full moon as an eerie wind rises and howls. We continue 
               crashing through the dying fields toward the dark village...

               INT. INDIANA'S HUT - NIGHT

               The wind swirls into the hut and Indiana's eyes open. He 
               lies still a moment and then sits up slowly. He sees Short 
               Round sleeping nearby.

               Sensing something strange, Indy gets to his feet. He steps 
               around Short Round and goes to the door of the hut.

               EXT. THE HUT - NIGHT

               Indy walks against the rising wind and looks around. The 
               village is asleep and seems deserted. Then he turns and sees 
               something.

               We follow small bare feet stumbling through the dust...

               Indy sees an emaciated child in rags running out of the 
               darkness. Indiana moves forward and the child runs toward 
               him. Indy grabs the little boy as he falls into his arms.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE SHAMAN'S HUT - NIGHT

               A few minutes later, the little boy is lying unconscious on 
               a blanket. Elders crouch around him. Indy is kneeling and 
               watches the shaman wet the boy's forehead with a rag and 
               drip water onto his lips.

               The little boy's eyes open and he begins to revive. Short 
               Round And Willie watch from a corner as the little boy looks 
               at all the faces peering down at him.

               The little boy's arm moves and he reaches out to Indy rather 
               than any of the others. Indy takes his small hand and sees 
               that the boy's fingers are cut and bruised -- his fingers 
               open and drop something into Indy's hand.

               The little boy tries to whisper. Indy has to lean close to 
               hear as the little boy's lips move again --

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         Sankara...

               A mother rushes into the hut now and kneels and hugs her 
               little boy. His skinny arms go around her as they are 
               reunited. Indy stands slowly and looks at what the little 
               boy gave him --

               It is a small tattered piece of cloth: an old fragment of a 
               miniature painting. Indiana looks at it with an expression 
               of recognition and apprehension...

                                     INDIANA
                         Sankara...

               EXT. THE VILLAGE - MORNING

               The camera follows Indiana -- he's walking fast and 
               determinedly. Villagers trot alongside of him, trying to 
               keep up with is pace as he questions them in Hindi.

               Indy approaches two large elephants and sees their guide 
               Sajnu trying to politely drag Willie toward one of them.

                                     INDIANA
                         Damn it , Willie, get on -- we've 
                         got to move out!

               Willie's head comes up over the back of the elephant as she's 
               helped from below -- there is a look of sheer terror on her 
               face.

                                     WILLIE
                         Whoa! Easy now -- nice elephant...

               Waiting by the second elephant, Short Round sees Indy coming 
               and runs up to him --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         I ride with you, Indy?

                                     INDIANA
                         Nope, you got a little surprise over 
                         there, Shorty.

               Short Round runs around the big elephant and sees a baby 
               elephant being brought out. He can't believe his luck --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Oh boy!

               Meanwhile Sajnu goads Willie's elephant over. The villagers 
               look grief stricken and many are crying as they watch the 
               three strangers' departure.

                                     WILLIE
                              (to Short Round)
                         This is the first time anybody ever 
                         cried when I left.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         They don't cry about you. They cry 
                         about the elephants leaving.

                                     WILLIE
                         Figures...

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         They got no food to feed them. So 
                         they taking the elephants away to 
                         sell them.

               Indy lumbers over on his elephant.

                                     INDIANA
                         All right, let's go. I want to get 
                         to Pankot before tomorrow night.

               She looks at Indiana as he rides past.

                                     WILLIE
                         Pankot?! I thought we were going to 
                         Delhi! Hey, wait a minute!
                              (looking at the 
                              villagers)
                         Can't somebody take me to Delhi?! I 
                         don't want to go to Pankot!

               Sajnu guides her elephant and Willie lurches forward --

                                     WILLIE
                              (yelling)
                         Indiana! Damn it! Why'd you change 
                         your mind? What did that kid tell 
                         you last night?!

               Indy ignores her hollering. The elephants move off through 
               the crowds of pitiful villagers. Indy sees the elders, 
               chieftain and the old shaman who brings his hands up to his 
               forehead as Indy rides past.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               The elephants move across the desolate countryside toward 
               the distant hills.

               EXT. THE TRAIL

               Indiana rides the lead elephant. Sajnu passes on foot guiding 
               Willie's elephant. With the tuxedo jacket wrapped around her 
               waist, Willie is dabbing perfume behind her ears.

                                     WILLIE
                              (to her elephant)
                         I think you need this more than me.

               Willie leans forward and puts perfume behind the elephant's 
               ears. Grimacing at the animal's smell she simply dumps the 
               rest of the perfume on the elephant's back.

               Willie yelps when the elephant's trunk comes back, sniffs 
               the foreign fragrance and suddenly trumpets in disgust.

                                     WILLIE
                         What're you complaining about, this 
                         is expensive stuff!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LOWER JUNGLES - DAY

               From a cliff, we see the elephants below passing into the 
               lower jungles.

               Spotting something on an overhanging tree branch, Short Round 
               stands up precariously on the baby elephant's back. He pulls 
               a vine from the tree as they pass under it. Plopping down 
               onto the baby elephant's back, he picks the wild fruit from 
               the vine --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Here you go, lunch time!

               The baby elephant's trunk comes back and takes the fruit. 
               Shorty looks up in the sky.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy, look!

               Indiana and Willie look up and see hundreds of enormous winged 
               creatures flapping across the afternoon sky.

                                     WILLIE
                         Those are very big bird.

               Sajnu says something and Indiana nods.

                                     INDIANA
                         Those aren't birds -- those are giant 
                         bats.

               Willie shudders as she watches the bats.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE HILLS - AFTERNOON

               An enormous sun silhouettes the three elephants trekking 
               westward.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A RIVER - LATER AFTERNOON

               The three elephants stand sucking up river water with their 
               trunks. Seated on the huge beasts, Willie, Short Round and 
               Indiana watch the thirsty animals.

                                     WILLIE
                         They must be pretty dumb to drink 
                         that awful-looking water.

               In response, Willie's elephant calmly lifts its trunk and 
               sprays her in the face. Short Round and Indy laugh as Willie 
               sits soaked and shocked.

                                     INDIANA
                         I think maybe we'll camp here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE RIVER - SUNSET

               A plume of water sprays. The three elephants submerge in a 
               deep, wide spot in the river. Indy wades in the current with 
               his shirt off. He and the guide splash water on the weary 
               animals.

               Short Round laughs and plays with the baby elephant. Wrapped 
               in its trunk, he's swung in the air and lands on the 
               elephant's back. Shorty makes a swan dive back into the water 
               and the baby elephant gives him a shower when he surfaces.

               EXT. UPRIVER

               Thirty yards upstream, birds and monkeys chatter in a tree. 
               In the shady river beneath, Willie surfaces coolly and wipes 
               hair from her eyes. She hums contentedly.

               Indiana wanders up the riverbank in his dripping trousers. 
               He notices Willie's wet clothes spread over a tree limb 
               hanging low over the water and then he sees Willie paddling 
               around.

                                     INDIANA
                         Hey, Willie -- I think you better 
                         get out now.

                                     WILLIE
                         Stark naked? You wish... If you're 
                         trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this 
                         is a very primitive approach.

                                     INDIANA
                         Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one 
                         who took your clothes off.
                              (shrugging)
                         I just came over to remind you that 
                         you never know what else might be in 
                         the water.

                                     WILLIE
                         Somehow I feel safer in here.

               As Indy turns and starts off, Willie reaches up to the tree 
               branch above her head and grabs her underwear. At this moment 
               we notice something awful:

               A BOA CONSTRICTOR is moving out along the branch, the enormous 
               snake slithering over Willie's clothes.

               Willie watches Indiana walk away as she reaches up for her 
               dress -- her hands feel something strange -- not the dress 
               and not the tree limb --

               Willie looks up and sees that she's pulling on a snake! She 
               SCREAMS as the boa constrictor falls off the tree on top of 
               her!

               Indy hears the scream and hears Willie calling to him. He 
               runs back toward the river. Stopping on the riverbank, he 
               sees Willie backing away in the water -- Indiana's already 
               starting to pull his boots off --

                                     WILLIE
                         Indy! Help me!

                                     INDIANA
                         Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is 
                         it?

                                     WILLIE
                         A snake!

               Suddenly Indiana freezes and a strange look crosses his face --

                                     INDIANA
                         A what...?

                                     WILLIE
                         A SNAKE!!

               He finally sees the boa constrictor thrashing in the water 
               close to Willie. He leaves his boots on.

                                     WILLIE
                         Hurry, help me out of here! What're 
                         you waiting for?!

                                     INDIANA
                         Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better 
                         idea.

                                     WILLIE
                         What?!

                                     INDIANA
                         First of all -- don't panic!

               Willie suddenly screams as the boa constrictor wraps around 
               her arm --

                                     WILLIE
                         It's got me! Indy, help me!

               Indy runs along the riverbank, trying to get closer to her, 
               but not about to jump into the river (due to his aversion to 
               snakes -- see Episode One: "Raiders of the Lost Ark").

                                     INDIANA
                         Don't let it pull you deeper!

                                     WILLIE
                         It's pulling me deeper!

                                     INDIANA
                         Don't let it curl around you!

                                     WILLIE
                         It's curling around me! Damn it, 
                         stop talking and do something!

               The snake is wrapping around her body and neck -- her head 
               is barely above water --

               On the riverbank, Indy reaches down and grabs a piece of 
               wood. But as he watches the repulsive reptile, he starts to 
               sweat and his fear and loathing overpower him --

                                     WILLIE
                         What's wrong?! Indy please help me!

               Indy groans and bolsters his courage -- he takes two steps 
               into the water -- but the complex is to strong and he can't 
               go any further. He drops the piece of wood...

                                     INDIANA
                         Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I 
                         tell you now.

                                     WILLIE
                         What?!

                                     INDIANA
                         Can you move your arm?

                                     WILLIE
                         Just one arm!

                                     INDIANA
                         Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- 
                         and pet the snake.

                                     WILLIE
                         PET IT??!!

                                     INDIANA
                         Yes, stroke it right along the 
                         maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.

                                     WILLIE
                         THE WHAT?!

                                     INDIANA
                         Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!

               In the water, Willie is whimpering as she lifts her hand and 
               starts petting the snake coiling around her pale body.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to 
                         crush me!

                                     INDIANA
                         Keep stroking it!

               Willie keeps rubbing her hand along the snakes head and back 
               and it slowly stops thrashing in the water.

                                     INDIANA
                         What's happening?

                                     WILLIE
                         It's starting to let go!

                                     INDIANA
                         That's good -- you're doing fine.

               Grimacing as she stares at the ugly serpent's head, Willie 
               keeps stroking it.

                                     WILLIE
                         It's letting go. I think it's -- I 
                         think it's going to sleep!

               Indiana looks relieved. He sees the snake starting to drift 
               away from Willie and she starts paddling back to shore, 
               collecting her floating clothes along the way.

               Holding her dripping dress against herself, she walks out of 
               the water toward Indy who smiles at her weakly.

                                     INDIANA
                         See -- I got you out...

               She slows and hauls off and punches him in the mouth. Indy 
               holds his jaw as she walks away infuriates.

                                     WILLIE
                         Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!

                                     INDIANA
                              (looking at the water)
                         I know the feeling...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

               By firelight, we see Sajnu feeding the big elephants while 
               Short Round feeds and talks to the baby elephant --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         You come to America with me, and we 
                         can get job in the circus -- you 
                         like that?

               The baby elephant trumpets affirmatively.

               A ways off, Willie stands wrapped in a blanket watching Shorty 
               and the elephant as she dries her hair by a campfire. Now 
               Indy comes up and drops an armload of wood for yet another 
               fire.

                                     WILLIE
                         Where'd you find your little 
                         bodyguard?

                                     INDIANA
                         I met Short Round when he tried to 
                         pick my pocket.

               Indiana kneels and arranges the wood.

                                     INDIANA
                         Shorty's family was killed when they 
                         bombed Shanghai. He was living on 
                         the streets.

                                     WILLIE
                              (smiling)
                         He'll be okay. He's a good kid.

               Indy strikes a match and lights the new fire.

                                     WILLIE
                         All these fires -- you expecting 
                         more snakes, Dr. Jones?

               She smiles snidely and continues drying her hair.

                                     INDIANA
                         By the way, how'd you end up in 
                         Shanghai?

                                     WILLIE
                         Well, when my nightclub career was 
                         run over by the Depression, some 
                         pinhead convinced me that "a girl 
                         could go places in the Orient..." 
                         So, look where I got.

               Indy picks up a blanket and spreads it on the ground.

                                     INDIANA
                         What about the future?

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch 
                         onto a good-looking, incredibly rich 
                         prince.

               Indy lies down on the blanket.

                                     INDIANA
                         I'd like to find one of those myself.

                                     WILLIE
                              (raising an eyebrow)
                         Oh really?

                                     INDIANA
                         Yeah, but he's got to be dead and 
                         buried for a couple of thousand years.
                              (smiling)
                         Fortune and glory...

                                     WILLIE
                         Is that what you're hoping to find 
                         at this palace, Dr. Jones?

                                     INDIANA
                         Maybe...

               Indy reaches into his pocket and removes the old piece of 
               cloth.

                                     WILLIE
                         What's that?

               She walks over to where he's lying down and sits on a boulder. 
               He hands her the cloth and she looks at it by the firelight.

                                     INDIANA
                         Something that kid gave me last night. 
                         It's a piece of an old manuscript.

               Willie sees a crude drawing in reds, blue and gold.

                                     INDIANA
                         The drawing shows a priest named 
                         Sankara who lived centuries ago.

                                     WILLIE
                         What does the writing say?

                                     INDIANA
                         It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of 
                         Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he 
                         met the Hindu god Shiva.

                                     WILLIE
                              (examining it)
                         That's Shiva? What's he giving the 
                         Priest?

                                     INDIANA
                         Legend says he told Sankara to go 
                         forth and combat evil. To do that he 
                         gave him five sacred stones that had 
                         magical powers.

                                     WILLIE
                              (looking at Indy)
                         You mean magical like the rock that 
                         was stolen from that village?

               Indy looks at her meaningfully.

                                     INDIANA
                         It could be.

               Willie seems frightened. She hands him the piece of cloth 
               and stands up.

                                     WILLIE
                              (quietly)
                         Fortune and glory... sweet dreams, 
                         Dr. Jones.

               She picks up a blanket and starts off.

                                     INDIANA
                         I think you should sleep closer.
                              (seeing her suspicious 
                              look)
                         I meant for safety.

                                     WILLIE
                              (smiling)
                         I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.

               She steps over to a tree by the fire where her clothes are 
               drying. Indy watches her pull her dried clothes from the 
               lower branches.

               She reaches up to remove another piece of her clothing -- 
               it's stuck to the tree and she looks up and yanks it. Suddenly 
               the piece of clothing moves!

               Two enormous wings open and the hideous face of a GIANT BAT 
               screeches and hisses at Willie! She screams hysterically as 
               the bat flaps against her, biting and scratching at her before 
               it finally takes off.

               The bat flies off into the darkness and Indy chuckles as he 
               watches Willie shaking as she backs slowly toward the fire --

                                     WILLIE
                         Did you see it?! It was one of those 
                         bats!
                              (staring into the 
                              darkness)
                         God, what else is out there...?!

               She quickly picks up her blanket and lays it out very close 
               to Indy.

                                     INDIANA
                         Couldn't keep away, huh?

                                     WILLIE
                         Just try and control yourself.

               Indiana watches her lie down and wrap herself in her blanket. 
               then he rolls over and tips his hat down over his eyes to 
               get some well-deserved shut-eye.

               In a moment, however, we see something grotesque and snake-
               like slide into frame and move towards Indy -- finally, we 
               realize it's an elephant's trunk. The trunk nudges Indy's 
               shoulder.

                                     INDIANA
                              (without looking)
                         Still scared? Okay, Willie, you can 
                         get closer if you want...

               The elephant's trunk moves closer and nuzzles Indy's neck.

                                     INDIANA
                         Honey, I knew you'd be the first one 
                         to give in...

               Now, we see that Short Round is guiding the baby elephant's 
               trunk with a prod. Willie watches, stifling a laugh as the 
               elephant's trunk sniffs Indiana's ear --

                                     INDIANA
                         You're going to start something I'm 
                         going to have to finish.
                              (moaning)
                         Okay, doll, you asked for it.

               Indiana rolls over, lifts his hat and hollers! He nearly 
               jumps out of his pants as he stares into the elephant's trunk. 
               Willie and Short Round dissolve into laughter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE JUNGLE - DAY

               Tall, vine-covered trees sway in the wind. Beneath them, the 
               elephants plough through the dense tropical forest. The sounds 
               of the teeming jungle multiply as Short Round surveys the 
               distant hills.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy, look!

                                     INDIANA
                         That's it. Pankot Palace.

               Willie looks off at the resplendent white Moghul-style palace 
               rising in the distance above the jungle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A JUNGLE CLEARING - LATER

               Their Mayapore guide walks toward the camera and suddenly 
               looks frightened. He barks commands and the elephants stop. 
               Indiana jumps down an joins the fearful guide.

               They stare at a small statue of a malevolent goddess with 
               eight arms. Around the goddess's neck, a carved necklace 
               displays small human heads -- her eight hands hold other 
               heads by their hair.

               Indiana moves closer to the statue as the terrified guide 
               backs away. Indy is fascinated by the ritual objects adorning 
               it: leaves, dead birds, rodents and turtles. Indiana grimaces 
               as he lifts a necklace of real pierced human fingers...

                                     WILLIE (O.S.)
                         Why are we stopping here?

               Indiana goes back and joins the scared, jabbering guide who 
               is helping Willie down from the elephant. Short Round jumps 
               down.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         What you look at, Indy?

                                     INDIANA
                         Just a statue.

                                     WILLIE
                         What's the guide talking about? He 
                         hasn't said a word the whole trip.

               Indy listens to the agitated guide and then speaks a few 
               words in Hindi back to him. They watch the distressed guide 
               turn the elephants and start away with them as fast as 
               possible.

                                     WILLIE
                         He's afraid of something.

                                     INDIANA
                         He said he couldn't take us any 
                         farther. He has to go sell the 
                         elephants.

                                     WILLIE
                         You mean we have to walk the rest of 
                         the way?

               Willie moans and follows Indy. Short Round watches the 
               elephants trudging away. The little elephant turns and looks 
               back. Short Round quickly wipes a tear from his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A PALACE APPROACH - AFTERNOON

               Indiana and Short Round hike up a rock-paved road beside a 
               high wall. Exhausted, carrying her high heels, Willie trudges 
               along behind them.

                                     WILLIE
                         -- shot at, fallen out of a plane, 
                         nearly drowned, squashed by a snake, 
                         attacked by a bat -- I smell like an 
                         elephant!
                              (yelling)
                         I tell you I'm not going to make it!

               Indiana finally stops. He walks back to Willie, suddenly 
               picks her us in his arms and starts carrying her the remaining 
               way. Willie is surprised and puzzled.

                                     INDIANA
                         Any more complaints?

                                     WILLIE
                              (smiling faintly)
                         Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this 
                         sooner...

               She doesn't seem to mind being carried by Indy. He arrives 
               at the entrance to the palace and puts her down -- she stands 
               close to him and he gently smoothes the collar of her dress.

                                     INDIANA
                         It doesn't feel like there's been 
                         any permanent damage.

               She smiles at him again and then turns around -- and whistles 
               as she sees Pankot Palace: a sprawling, monumental mixture 
               of Moghul and Rajput styles, the palace is an extravaganza 
               of Princely architecture.

               EXT. A BRIDGE

               The three travelers start across a marble bridge toward the 
               main entrance. Lined along the bridge, palace guards stand 
               with lances.

               As the threesome passes, the first Rajput guard snaps noisily 
               to attention and Willie jumps. As Willie continues across 
               the bridge, the other guards snap to attention in sequence 
               and she grins, enjoying the attention.

               INT. THE OUTER COURTYARD

               Short Round and Willie follow Indiana through a dark archway 
               into a glittering courtyard. The palace seems deserted and 
               foreboding.

                                     INDIANA
                         Hello?... (hello?)... (hello?)

               Indy's voice echoes off the marble facades -- three enormous 
               Rajput guards with curved swords in their sashes appear 
               silently at opposite sides of the courtyard.

                                     WILLIE
                              (frightened)
                         Hi... (hi)... (hi)...

               Then, a tall severe-looking Indian in an English suit 
               materializes out of the shadows and comes forward slowly. 
               CHATTAR LAL appraises the intruders suspiciously:

               He sees a whoozy beauty in a weary evening gown; a dirty 
               Chinese kid with a baseball cap; a rugged-looking American 
               carrying a bullwhip...

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         I would say you look rather lost.
                              (disdainfully)
                         But then I cannot imagine where in 
                         the world the three of you would 
                         look at home...

                                     INDIANA
                              (smiling evenly)
                         Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on 
                         our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- 
                         and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana 
                         Jones.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                              (surprised)
                         Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?

                                     WILLIE
                         Hard to believe, isn't it...?

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         I remember first hearing your name 
                         when I was studying at Oxford. I am 
                         Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His 
                         Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.

               He bows and Willie sort of curtsies.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         Welcome to Pankot Palace.

               INT. PANKOT PALACE - AFTERNOON

               They walk along the marble halls, past dazzling walls inlaid 
               with pieces of mirror and semi-precious stones. Fountains 
               spray in ivory courtyards and they gaze in awe at the ornate 
               splendor.

               As Willie walks with Shorty she appraises the chronological 
               portraits of the Pankot Prices that line the hall. Dissipated 
               faces, elegant faces, evil faces -- she reacts to them.

                                     WILLIE
                              (to Short Round)
                         How'd you like to run into him in a 
                         dark alley... that one's kind of 
                         cute... I could see myself married 
                         to a prince like that...

               Ahead of them Chattar Lal walks with Indy and questions him 
               suspiciously --

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         The plane crash and your journey 
                         here sound -- most incredible.

                                     WILLIE
                         You should have been there...

                                     INDIANA
                         We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah 
                         would let us stay tonight. We'll be 
                         on out way in the morning.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         I am only his humble servant, but 
                         the Maharajah usually listens to my 
                         advice.

                                     WILLIE
                         Is that him?

               They've come to the last in the row of Princes portraits. 
               Willie stops and looks up disappointedly at a picture of an 
               aged, immensely corpulent Rajput prince.

                                     WILLIE
                              (politely)
                         He's not exactly what we call "a 
                         spring chicken".

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the 
                         present Maharajah's late father.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh -- good. And maybe the present 
                         Maharajah is a little younger? And 
                         thinner?

               Two female servants approach silently and bow.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         They will escort you to your rooms 
                         now. You will be provided with fresh 
                         clothes. Tonight you will be dining 
                         with His Highness.

                                     WILLIE
                         Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck 
                         is changing. But look at me -- my 
                         god, I've to get ready!

               She hurried off with one of the servants toward her room. 
               Chattar Lal smiles coolly at Indiana --

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         Eight o'clock in the Pleasure 
                         Pavilion.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PLEASURE PAVILION - NIGHT

               An extraordinary gold dome rises in the middle of the 
               elaborate gardens. The Pleasure Pavilion is ablaze with torch 
               lights, flickering candles and exotic music.

               Indiana comes out of the palace with Short Round. Indy has 
               on a tweed jacket and a necktie - his university professor's 
               outfit. Short Round has been cleaned up, but still sports 
               his baseball cap.

               Willie joins them, looking stunning is a silk Western-styled 
               gown. She's also been loaned some Moghul jewelry which 
               sparkles on her neck and arms.

                                     INDIANA
                         You look like a princess.

               Willie's flattered by the first nice thing Indy's said to 
               her.

                                     WILLIE
                         It's sort of like being in heaven.

               They cross the garden toward the pavilion and Willie's eyes 
               are like a kid's at Christmas.

               INT. THE PLEASURE PAVILION

               As they enter, Indiana gives a half-dressed dancing girl the 
               once-over as she spins to the music of drums and "vinhas".

                                     INDIANA
                              (smiling)
                         I've always had a weakness for folk 
                         dancing.

                                     WILLIE
                              (snidely)
                         She might get away with that act 
                         here, but she'd never make it in a 
                         real nightclub.

               They walk among the rich court ministers and Indian merchants. 
               Chattar Lal approaches with a British cavalry captain in 
               uniform.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         We are fortunate tonight to have 
                         some many unexpected guests. His is 
                         Captain Phillip Blumburtt.

               Blumburtt bows to Willie and Indiana.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         Captain Blumburtt and his troops are 
                         here to check up on the "natives".

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                              (politely)
                         Just a routine inspection tour.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         The British worry so about their 
                         Empire -- it makes us feel like well-
                         cared-for children.

                                     WILLIE
                         Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call 
                         the Maharajah's wife?

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         His Highness has not yet taken a 
                         wife.

                                     WILLIE
                              (happily)
                         No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met 
                         the right woman...

               As Willie chatters on with the Prime Minister, Indiana wanders 
               off. He moves to a wall where bronze statues and strange 
               devotional objects are displayed.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                              (joining Indy)
                         Interested in local curios?

                                     INDIANA
                         No. But I am interested in the occult. 
                         And this is a kryta.

               Indiana picks up a small clay figurine and examines it.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                              (grimacing)
                         Charming.

                                     INDIANA
                         It's like the voodoo dolls of West 
                         Africa. The kryta represents your 
                         enemy -- and gives you complete power 
                         over him.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                         Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish 
                         is disappearing.

                                     INDIANA
                         You think so?

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                         Of course. Admittedly, it's taken 
                         time. Britain's controlled India for 
                         almost two hundred years now.

               Indiana smiles at the somewhat pompous bureaucrat.

                                     INDIANA
                         You're hanging on better here than 
                         you did in America.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                              (smiling sourly)
                         This is a different situation, Dr. 
                         Jones. These people are like children. 
                         We have to lead them slowly into the 
                         twentieth century.

               Indiana puts the doll down and looks over at Chattar Lal and 
               Willie.

                                     INDIANA
                         The Prime Minister doesn't seem that 
                         naive.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                         No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power 
                         behind the throne and all that. He 
                         actually runs this whole province.

               Indy and the Prime Minister exchange distant looks as Willie 
               comes back over to Indiana. She talks to him conspiratorially --

                                     WILLIE
                         I think this Maharajah is swimming 
                         in money. Maybe coming here wasn't 
                         such a bad idea.

               Blumburtt finds these Americans quite suspect and seems 
               relieved when he hears a drum.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                         I believe we're being called to 
                         dinner.

                                     WILLIE
                         Finally!

               As the drum beats the assembled guests move toward a long, 
               low table surrounded by colorful pillows. Short Round follows 
               with a little monkey he's found perched on his arm.

               As everyone stands around the table, Chattar Lal makes an 
               announcement in Hindi and then in English --

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         His Supreme Highness, guardian of 
                         Rajput tradition -- the Maharajah of 
                         Pankot -- Zalim Singh.

               All eyes are on two solid silver doors which open -- and 
               through which now walks the MAHARAJAH ZALIM SINGH. Everyone 
               is bowing, including Indiana and Willie, who looks amazed --

                                     WILLIE
                         That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!

                                     INDIANA
                         Maybe he likes older women.

               Indeed, Zalim Singh is only thirteen. Outfitted in silver 
               and gold brocade, festooned with enormous jewels, the little 
               Maharajah gazes imperiously at the bowing crowd -- and then 
               glares at Short Round.

               Indy sees Short Round chewing gum, staring antagonistically 
               at the Maharajah. Indy pushes Short Round into a bowing 
               position.

               The Maharajah finally sits down on golden pillows. He nods 
               and his guests take their seats. Indiana sees Willie's dreams 
               of queendom have vanished.

                                     INDIANA
                         Cheer up, you lost your prince, but 
                         dinner's on the way.

                                     WILLIE
                         I've never been so hungry in my 
                         life...

               Servants appear with silver platters of steaming food. They 
               place a platter in front of Willie and she stares at it in 
               amazement:

               It's a whole roasted boar, replete with a decorative arrow 
               piercing its bloated stomach and tiny broiled baby bores 
               placed around it as if they were suckling on their well-cooked 
               mother.

                                     WILLIE
                              (grimacing)
                         My god, sort of gruesome, isn't it...?

               Seeing the meat being served, Indiana looks across the table 
               at Blumburtt who seems equally puzzled. Meanwhile, the little 
               Maharajah whispers to his Prime Minster. Then Chattar Lal 
               speaks to the table --

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         His Highness wants me to welcome his 
                         visitors. Especially the renowned 
                         Dr. Jones from America.

               Indy bows slightly toward the Maharajah.

                                     INDIANA
                         We are honored to be here.

               Servants put down another platter. Willie stares at an 
               enormous steaming boa constrictor on the platter. With a 
               flash of a knife, a servant slits the huge snake and exposes 
               a mass of squirming, live baby eels inside...

                                     WILLIE
                         Suddenly I'm not so hungry...

               Meanwhile, Indiana is chatting politely with the Prime 
               Minister.

                                     INDIANA
                         I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. 
                         I was examining some of the 
                         Maharajah's artifacts.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         A very fine collection of very old 
                         pieces, don't you think?

                                     INDIANA
                         Yes, very fine. But not all of the 
                         pieces look old. Some were carved 
                         recently and look like images used 
                         by the Thuggees to worship the goddess 
                         Kali.

               At the mention of the Thuggees, the Indians at the table 
               quiet, as it a taboo has been broken. Chattar Lal glares at 
               Indiana.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         Dr. Jones, you know very well that 
                         the Thuggee cult has been dead for 
                         nearly a century.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                         Of course. The Thuggees were an 
                         obscenity that worshipped Kali with 
                         human sacrifices. The British Army 
                         wiped them out about the time of the 
                         Mutiny of 1857.

               Short Round avoids the dinner by feeding it to his little 
               monkey as he listens to the scary conversation.

               The talk is bad enough, but Willie finds the food 
               unbelievable! A servant leans over her shoulder and places a 
               six-inch long BUG on her plate!

               Willie whimpers quietly as she watches the fat merchant next 
               to her lift one of the black, shiny baked-beetles -- and 
               crack it in two! The man proceeds to enthusiastically suck 
               the gooey innards out.

                                     MERCHANT
                              (looking at Willie)
                         But you're not eating!

                                     WILLIE
                              (weakly)
                         I uh -- had bugs for lunch.

               Meanwhile, Indiana continues to politely needle Chattar Lal.

                                     INDIANA
                         I suppose stories of the Thuggees 
                         die hard.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         There are no stories anymore.

                                     INDIANA
                         Well, I don't know... we came here 
                         from a small village and the peasants 
                         there told us that the Pankot Palace 
                         was growing powerful again -- because 
                         of some ancient evil.

               Indiana smiles and shrugs.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                              (sneeringly)
                         Their stories are just fear and 
                         folklore.

                                     INDIANA
                              (coolly)
                         Maybe... but how do you explain The 
                         Thuggee shrine I saw right below the 
                         palace?

               Indy catches a glance between the little Maharajah and the 
               prime minister, who answers slowly --

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         The local peasants are just as 
                         superstitious. You're very observant, 
                         Dr. Jones. But you're beginning to 
                         worry Capt. Blumburtt.

               Blumburtt's phlegmatic attitude has changed to curiosity.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                         I'm not worried, Prime Minister, 
                         just interested.

               During their conversation, Willie listens to beetles SNAPPING 
               and she watches revolted as the other dinner guests suck the 
               gooey insides out of the bugs.

                                     WILLIE
                              (to Short Round)
                         Give me your hat...

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         What for?

                                     WILLIE
                         I'm going to puke in it...

               Meanwhile, Indy continues ingeniously with Chattar Lal.

                                     INDIANA
                         You know the villagers also claimed 
                         that this palace stole something 
                         from them.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         Dr. Jones, in our country a guest 
                         does not usually insult his host.

                                     INDIANA
                         Sorry, I thought we were just talking 
                         about folklore.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                              (trying to make peace)
                         I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.
                              (but interested)
                         What was it they claimed was stolen?

                                     INDIANA
                         Something magical. A sacred rock.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                              (condescendingly)
                         There, you see, Captain. A rock!

                                     INDIANA
                         When they lost this rock their fields 
                         and animals died. They also said 
                         their children were taken from them.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         I think that's enough of this 
                         nonsense, Dr. Jones...

               Indiana smiles faintly at Chattar Lal's anger. Across the 
               table, Willie looks pale and motions to the waiter.

                                     WILLIE
                         So you have something, you know, 
                         simple -- like soup or something?

               The servant goes off and returns with a covered bowl. He 
               uncovers it and Willie looks at a soup with a dozen eyeballs 
               floating in it.

                                     MERCHANT
                         Looks delicious!

                                     WILLIE
                         I wanna go home...

               Willie whimpers and tears start down her cheeks.

                                     INDIANA
                              (to Chattar Lal)
                         I was dubious myself at first. Then 
                         something connected -- the village's 
                         rock and the old legend of the Sankara 
                         Stones...

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                              (controlling himself)
                         Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to 
                         vicious rumors. I seem to remember 
                         that in Honduras you were accused of 
                         being a grave robber rather than a 
                         scientist.

                                     INDIANA
                              (shrugging)
                         The newspapers exaggerated the 
                         incident.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar 
                         threaten to cut your head off if you 
                         ever returned to his country?

                                     INDIANA
                         That was a misunderstanding.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                              (smiling)
                         Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         I have heard the terrible stories of 
                         the evil Thuggee cult...

               When the little Marahajah speaks it surprises everyone and 
               there is silence.

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         I thought the stories were told to 
                         frighten children. Later, I learned 
                         that the Thuggee cult was once real 
                         and did unspeakable things.

               The Maharajah looks at Indiana.

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         I am ashamed of what happened here 
                         so many years ago. We keep these 
                         objects -- to remind us that this 
                         will never again happen in my kingdom!

                                     INDIANA
                              (after a moment)
                         I'm sorry if I've offended you.

               Now, more trays are whisked in by servants.

                                     MERCHANT
                         Ah, dessert!

               Short Round's monkey suddenly screeches and takes off. Willie 
               closed here eyes in dread -- but curiosity gets the best of 
               her and she looks -- it's worse than she could imagine:

               Plates full of small, dead monkey heads! (Production note: 
               because of his extremely sensitive nature, the director has 
               requested that these monkey heads be simulated).

               The tops of the monkey's skulls have been cut off and sit 
               loose like little covers. Willie watches in utter dismay as 
               the Maharajah and his guests remove the skull-tops and start 
               dipping spoons into what's inside --

                                     MERCHANT
                         Chilled monkey brains!

               Willie keels over, crashing backwards in a dead faint!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A PALACE HALL - LATER

               Women servants help a wobbly-kneed Willie toward her room.

               EXT. THE PELASURE GARDEN - NIGHT

               Hundreds of lanterns illuminate the garden where after dinner 
               drinks are served, cigars lighted and hookah pipes puffed 
               on.

               Indiana comes out of the pavilion into the garden with Capt. 
               Blumburtt and they talk quietly.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                         Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you 
                         say?

                                     INDIANA
                         Even if they were trying to scare us 
                         away, a devout Hindu would never 
                         touch meat.
                              (looking around)
                         Makes you wonder what these people 
                         are...

               Now, the little Maharajah comes over with his retinue and he 
               reaches for Indy's whip which Short Round is carrying.

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         I have seen this thing. What is it, 
                         Dr. Jones?

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Hey, nobody touches Indy's whip!

               Short Round grabs for it, but Indiana restrains him.

                                     INDIANA
                         We're guests here, Shorty.

               The Maharajah glares are Short Round and gives the whip to 
               Indy.

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         You will show me how it works please.

               Indy bows to the little prince and smiles ironically --

                                     INDIANA
                         Your wish is my command, your 
                         Highness.

               While Short Round watches angrily, Indiana walks across the 
               garden and unfurls the whip. Indy sees a servant lighting a 
               candle.

               Suddenly the whip flies and CRACKS like a pistol shot. The 
               candle disappears! Indiana whirls and CRACKS the whip again, 
               snagging a flower out of a dancing girl's hair.

               The Maharajah reacts like any kid -- he whoops happily.

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         That is wonderful! Please teach me 
                         how!

               Short Round sulks as he listens to Indiana instructing the 
               Maharajah on how to hold the whip. As the young prince 
               practices the grip, Indy notices Chattar Lal slip behind a 
               fountain to talk to a dark figure in robes who appears.

               Indiana sees Chattar Lal bow to the dark figure -- and Indy 
               catches a glimpse of the stranger's pale face and dark hollow 
               eyes. Then the robed apparition seems to disappear.

               Meanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the Maharajah 
               unfurls the whip for his first attempt. He flings the whip 
               but it flies back and snaps -- biting his own cheek.

               There's a stunned silence -- then Short Round laughs at the 
               little prince who is holding his wounded cheek. The incensed 
               Maharajah suddenly flashes the whip as Short Round.

               Short Round grabs the end of it and pulls hard -- the whip 
               is tugged taut between the two hostile boys. As they draw 
               near each other, Short Round sees something weird:

               The little Maharajah's eyes begin glowing yellow and he hisses 
               softly in a strange voice. Nobody else sees or hears the 
               bizarre transformation...

               Indiana finally intercedes -- he grabs Short Round by the 
               neck.

                                     INDIANA
                         Okay, Short Round, let go of it.

               Short Round lets go and Indy gently takes the whip back from 
               the little prince.

                                     INDIANA
                         The Turks say that a whip can be an 
                         enemy even to its owner. If you get 
                         some rope, it'll be easier to learn 
                         with, your Highness. Now, I think 
                         we'll say goodnight.

               The Maharajah and Short Round stare hostilely at each other 
               as Indy recoils his whip.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A PALACE HALL - NIGHT

               Short Round walks beside Indiana down the shadowy hall toward 
               their room. Short Round has Indy's whip curled around his 
               shoulder. The little fellow yawns and shakes his head.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         That little Maharajah think he big 
                         stuff.

                                     INDIANA
                         You don't like him do you?

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Next time I flatten him! Did you see 
                         his eyes?

                                     INDIANA
                         No.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy, they glow like fire and get 
                         real crazy! Then he talk in this 
                         real scary voice!

               Indy tousles Short Round's hair.

                                     INDIANA
                         He was afraid of you. He knows a 
                         tough guy when he sees one.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                              (not so sure)
                         Yeah, that's what happened...

               They reach their room and Short Round opens the door.

                                     INDIANA
                         I better see how Willie is.

               Short Round shakes his head scornfully as Indy crosses the 
               hall and knocks on another door. After a moment, the door 
               opens and Willie is standing there in a tempting nightgown.

                                     INDIANA
                         I brought you something.

               He holds up something wrapped in a piece of silk.

                                     WILLIE
                              (disgusted)
                         Not leftovers?

                                     INDIANA
                         No -- real food.

               Willie opens the bundle suspiciously -- then her face lights 
               up as she examines the breads and fruits inside.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh, it is real food... it's beautiful.

               She bites happily into a piece of fruit -- its juice runs 
               down her chin and Indy wipes it off gently with his hand. 
               The mouth deliberately seductive and Willie is not displeased.

                                     WILLIE
                         You're nice. Listen, I'm taking 
                         applications -- how'd you like to be 
                         my palace slave?

                                     INDIANA
                              (smiling)
                         Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?

               Indy touches her necklace -- then his hand caresses her neck 
               and ear. She shivers slightly and speaks softly.

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah -- and nothing else.
                              (smiling)
                         That shock you?

                                     INDIANA
                              (shaking his head)
                         I'm a scientist. I like doing research 
                         on certain "nocturnal activities" --

               She smiles and puts a grape to his lips. He opens his mouth 
               takes it and chews it.

                                     WILLIE
                         You mean like love rituals...

               He swallows the grape and they move toward each other slowly 
               to kiss, revealing the passion that's simmering.

                                     INDIANA
                         And mating customs...

               They kiss again more heatedly.

                                     WILLIE
                         Primitive sexual practices?

                                     INDIANA
                         You're talking to an authority in 
                         that area.

               They kiss again hungrily --

                                     WILLIE
                         You're dying to come into my room, 
                         aren't you?

                                     INDIANA
                         You want me so bad, why don't you 
                         invite me?

                                     WILLIE
                         Too proud to admit you're crazy about 
                         me, Dr. Jones?

                                     INDIANA
                         I think you're too used to getting 
                         you own way, Willie...

               They kiss yet again -- and Indy breaks it off, just to show 
               he's still in control. He backs away toward his room.

                                     WILLIE
                              (watching him)
                         We'll see who gives in first -- I'll 
                         leave my door open.

                                     INDIANA
                         Don't catch cold.

                                     WILLIE
                         Dr. Jones?

               Indy stops by his door and sees Willie smiling as she holds 
               up five fingers --

                                     WILLIE
                         Five minutes... you'll be back over 
                         here in five minutes...

                                     INDIANA
                         You're dreaming, Willie. You want to 
                         make it real, just knock on my door.

               He winks. She waves. But neither one will surrender first. 
               Willie goes into her room, leaving the door ajar. Indy opens 
               his door.

               INT. INDIANA'S SUITE

               Indy comes in and closes the door -- leaving it open a crack. 
               He stands and listens, waiting for her to come over.

               INT. WILLIE'S SUITE

               Willie stands likewise by her door, waiting to hear Indy 
               come back over.

               INT. INDIANA'S SUITE

               Indiana shrugs and walks over to a couch and starts taking 
               off his tweed jacket and necktie --

                                     INDIANA
                         Five minutes... fat chance.

               INT. WILLIE'S SUIT

               Willie moves around her lavish suite, turning down lights, 
               creating a romantic effect, checking herself in a mirror --

                                     WILLIE
                              (confidently)
                         Five minutes, Dr. Jones...

               INT. INDIANA'S SUITE

               Indy undresses in the magnificently decorated room: wall 
               paintings show palace scenes and landscapes; life-size figures 
               dance and there are full-scale portraits or Rajput princes 
               and prancing horses. But Indy's more concerned with lust 
               than with art.

                                     INDIANA
                              (muttering)
                         ...want me to be her palace slave!

               He picks up his whip and smiles, considering using it on 
               her. Then he just grumbles and tosses the bullwhip onto the 
               couch.

               INT. WILLIE'S SUITE

               Lying in bed in a seductive pose, Willie waits for Indy to 
               show up and she starts to look worried. She grabs a clock 
               and shakes it to see if it's working. She taps her fingers 
               irritably wondering in her charm has failed...

               INT. INDIANA'S SUITE

               We see another clock ticking. Looking annoyed, Indy tosses a 
               boot at it and the clock falls on its face, setting of the 
               alarm.

               On the chaise lounge in front of Indy's bed, Short Round 
               moves groggily and sees Indy turning off the alarm.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                              (half asleep)
                         Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and 
                         keep eye on things...

                                     INDIANA
                         Okay, Shorty... see you in the 
                         morning... I'm going to have a little -- 
                         word with Willie.

               Indy finally shakes his head and gives in to his animal 
               instincts. He buttons his shirt, puts his boots back on and 
               grabs his leather jacket.

               As he puts on his jacket he walks past the life-sized 
               paintings of armed guards standing in silent vigil. Suddenly 
               we see something frightening behind him: one of the wall 
               paintings sees to come to life!

               A large figure in robes and a turban looms out from the wall 
               and lifts a silk cord -- the figure wraps the cord suddenly 
               around Indiana's neck!

               The huge assassin stands behind Indy, twisting the cord even 
               tighter around his neck. As Indy attempts to break free he 
               sees the assassin's face is a mirror -- and a strange yellow 
               light glowing in the killer's eyes.

               INT. WILLIE'S SUITE

               Willie's finally had enough waiting and she gets out of beg 
               petulantly.

                                     WILLIE
                         He's not coming... I can't believe 
                         it...

               She walks across the room and opens the door. She looks out 
               the empty hall -- and her resolve starts to weaken --

                                     WILLIE
                         Well...
                              (bracing herself)
                         No! I'm not going over there...

               She comes back into her room and kicks the door closed.

                                     WILLIE
                         Sleep tight, Dr. Jones!
                              (suddenly melancholy)
                         I could've been your greatest 
                         adventure...

               INT. INDIANA'S SUITE

               Indy shoves the assassin backwards, ramming the big man into 
               the wall. The assassin maintains his deathgrip -- while on 
               the chaise, Short Round sleeps through it all!

               Gasping futilely for air, Indy sinks slowly to his knees -- 
               his eyes bulge and he stares at the tiny, smiling skulls at 
               the ends of the death-cord wrapped around the assassin's 
               fists.

               Indiana sinks lower and then feels something -- desperately 
               he grabs a brass pot on the floor by the handle and swings 
               it with his last strength, smashing it up into the assassin's 
               head with a skull-crushing clang!

               The assassin is stunned and Indiana curls forward pulling 
               him into a somersault and sending him flying over his back. 
               The assassin crashes on his spine next to the chaise. Short 
               Round still doesn't wake up.

               Indiana rips the cord from around his neck and gasps for 
               breath. He sees the assassin pulling a knife. Indiana dives 
               as the knife flies through the air and slams into the wall.

               Indiana grabs his whip, rolls and lands on his feet. As the 
               assassin tries to retreat, Indy unleashes his whip -- it 
               CRACKS and wraps around the killer's neck.

               The big man struggles, pulling on the whip, trying to release 
               it from his throat -- and Indiana holds fast, watching the 
               killer gasping for air now as his face turns red.

               Suddenly the assassin does a full-blown backward somersault 
               which rips the whip out of Indy's hand. The assassin has an 
               instant to grin victoriously --

               Until he sees that the whip handle is arching toward the 
               ceiling where is gets caught on the revolving fan! The 
               surprised assassin it tugged upwards -- and the whip twists 
               around the ceiling fan like fishing-line around a fishing-
               reel --

               And like a doomed flounder, the assassin is slowly reeled up 
               and dragged toward the ceiling, his toes lifting off the 
               floor. The assassin screams as he is hanged! His legs twitch 
               in his death throes -- and below him, Short Round finally 
               wakes up.

               Always Indiana's protector, Shorty instinctively leaps off 
               the couch and draws a small dagger --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Don't worry, Indy! Where are they?!

               Short Round spins a 360, then looks up and does a double-
               take seeing the dead assassin twisting slowly around the 
               ceiling fan. Indy takes Short Round by the shoulders and 
               turns him away from the grisly sight.

                                     INDIANA
                         It's okay, it's over -- go turn off 
                         the fan.

               Short goes over and turns off the fan -- the assassin's body 
               drops and Indy recoils his whip. Suddenly they hear a hideous 
               scream -- Willie!

               INT. WILLIE'S SUITE

               In a tight closeup: Willie screams again. She's lying in bed 
               looking down at something --

               Moving up her shapely leg, a green and black, monstrous-
               looking insect crawls onto her stomach and Willie stops 
               breathing. Immobilized by fear, Willie watches in silent 
               agony as the hideous insect climbs slowly up her breast and 
               slithers toward her neck.

               Across the suite, the doors burst open and Indiana rushes 
               in. Shorty is behind him, carrying Indy's whip. Indiana leaps 
               on a stool and slides up to the bed to save Willie --

               Then he spots the giant insect crawling on her and decides 
               to have some fun.

                                     INDIANA
                         This a cheap trick to get me over 
                         here?

               Willie speaks with desperate, fearful precision --

                                     WILLIE
                         No -- don't you see -- crawling --

                                     INDIANA
                         What -- the bug?

               Willie is petrified and shaking.

                                     WILLIE
                         Get -- the -- bug -- off!

                                     INDIANA
                         Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an 
                         ugly critter like that!

                                     SHORT ROUND
                              (grinning)
                         Uh uh -- me neither!

               Willie looks at the man-of-action like he's insane. Then she 
               feels the bug crawling onto her cheek --

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh no -- oh no!!

                                     INDIANA
                              (studying the bug)
                         You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad 
                         because they were eating his friends 
                         for dinner.

                                     WILLIE
                         Please -- oh please, I'm going to 
                         die! Get it off!

               Indiana shrugs and leans over and casually swats the horrible 
               bug off her face. He and Short Round watch the insect skid 
               across the floor -- and suddenly disappear as if by magic!

               Puzzled, they wander toward the wall, leaving Willie behind, 
               bathed in sweat, staring at the ceiling --

                                     WILLIE
                         What did I do to deserve this trip?!

               Kneeling by the wall, Short Round examines the baseboard --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         It went under. Hey, I feel wind, 
                         Indy.

               Indiana knocks on the wall and considers the hollow sound. 
               He moves back and looks at the whole wall. Behind him, Willie 
               moves past --

                                     WILLIE
                         I'm packing! I'm getting out of here 
                         right now tonight!

               She dashes behind a screen to start getting dressed. Meanwhile 
               Indy feels the marble walls. He moves to a niche in which 
               there is a small statue of Ganesha, the friendly elephant 
               god.

               Indiana lifts the statue -- and a panel in the wall opens 
               slowly. Short Round looks amazed. Indy watches the light 
               fall across the far wall of a tunnel as the door opens slowly.

               Indy peers into the tunnel at an old wall painting. Spiderly 
               Sanskrit calligraphy runs under a flanking illustration of a 
               prince bowing before a god.

               Indy reads aloud an inscription in Sanskrit.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         What does it mean, Indy?

                                     INDIANA
                              (translating)
                         "Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. 
                         Do not betray his truth."

               Indy takes out the piece of cloth the boy gave him in 
               Mayapore, the similarities are striking. It is also a picture 
               of Shiva Sankara.

               He repeats aloud the inscription also written on the cloth.

               Over behind the screen, Willie's getting into some silk pants 
               with an Indian-style brocade bodice top --

                                     WILLIE
                         I don't care if I have to walk to 
                         Delhi, I'm -- hey!

               She notices Indy and Short Round bending to enter the dark 
               tunnel behind the wall.

                                     WILLIE
                         Wait a minute! What're you -- where're 
                         you going?!

               Indy pokes his head back into the room --

                                     INDIANA
                         Lock your door and don't leave until 
                         we get back.

               He disappears behind the wall and Willie looks worried.

               INT. A PALACE TUNNEL - NIGHT

               Indy and Short Round enter the secret passage and move forward 
               slowly into the inky darkness.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         I don't think we suppose to be in 
                         here, Indy...

               They creep slowly down the dark tunnel. It grows smaller and 
               Indy ducks his head.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         I step on something.

               Their footsteps crunch on the tunnel floor.

                                     INDIANA
                         You're right, there's something all 
                         over the floor...

               Even Short Round has to duck and Indy finally kneels to his 
               hands and knees.

                                     INDIANA
                         We'll have to crawl.

               As they crawl, their hands and knees continue to crunch on 
               whatever it is littering the ground.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy, the floor -- there is something 
                         alive!

               Indiana gets a match out of his pocket. He snaps it with his 
               thumb and the match flares -- a hideous insectarium: a living 
               collection of the world's ugliest anthropoids, hexapods and 
               arachnids.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Holy smoke -- I'm scared, Indy!

               Indiana turns and sees something else --

                                     INDIANA
                         There's a chamber here. Come on --

               Indy finds an oil lamp on the wall and lights it. Short Round 
               happily scampers into the chamber and Indy follows him. 
               Suddenly the door slides shut -- trapping them inside!

               INT. THE CHAMBER

               Indiana lights a match and finds another oil lamp. He and 
               Short Round look for a way to open the door that closed behind 
               them, but they have no luck.

                                     INDIANA
                         Damn!

               Then they hear Willie's voice echoing down the short tunnel.

                                     WILLIE (O.S.)
                         Hey -- where are you?!

               INT. WILLIE'S SUITE

               Back in the suite, Willie stands by the entrance to the secret 
               passage, peering into the dark tunnel --

                                     WILLIE
                         Indiana Jones?! Are you in there?!

               INT. THE CHAMBER

               Indy mutters irritably to himself --

                                     INDIANA
                         Yes, we're in here...

               He looks everywhere for something to open the door. Short 
               Round spots a loose brick and moves it --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy, I found a --

               Suddenly they hear a rumble and Indy turns to see the opposite 
               wall moving -- the spikes start appearing! Their lethal points 
               protrude from the wall as it starts closing in toward Indy 
               and Short Round.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy!

               Shorty points up and Indiana sees more spikes descending 
               from the ceiling! Indy turns toward the door and shouts --

                                     INDIANA
                         Uh -- Willie?!
                              (louder)
                         Willie, you better get down here!

               INT. WILLIE'S SUITE

               Willie listens and looks scared --

                              (shouting back)
                         What?!

                                     INDIANA (O.S.)
                         Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're 
                         in trouble!!

                                     SHORT ROUND (O.S.)
                         Willie, help!!

               Willie is frightened, confused and jumping around --

               INT. THE SPIKE CHAMBER

               The deadly spikes inch slowly toward them from the wall and 
               ceiling. They start pounding on the door and shout --

                                     INDIANA
                         Willie, damn it! Get down here, NOW

               INT. WILLIE'S SUITE

               Willie finds the courage to finally whimper and step into 
               the dark passage --

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh hell -- I bet I get all dirty 
                         again!

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               Willie starts down the dark tunnel toward the chamber.

                                     INDIANA (O.S.)
                         WILLIE?!

                                     WILLIE
                         I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! 
                         What's that?! There's stuff all over 
                         the floor! I can't see a thing!

               INT. THE SPIKE CHAMBER

               They hear her coming and Indy watches nervously as the spikes 
               draw even closer --

                                     INDIANA
                         Move, Willie! Faster!

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               Willie crawls and crunches on the littered floor --

                                     WILLIE
                         It's all wet and icky! Aaahh -- things 
                         are moving!!

               She sees the low lamp by the door to the chamber.

                                     SHORT ROUND (O.S.)
                         Please, Willie!

               She grabs the lamp and turns it up so it burns brighter. She 
               looks around -- and SCREAMS!! She sees the sickening, swarming 
               mass of glistening insects crawling toward her, attracted by 
               the light --

                                     WILLIE
                              (hysterical)
                         There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! 
                         Help me!

                                     INDIANA (O.S.)
                         Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF 
                         HERE!

               Willie pounds on the door --

                                     WILLIE
                         OPEN THE DOOR! LET ME IN!!

               INT. THE SPIKE ROOM

               The spikes close in --

                                     INDIANA
                         GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and 
                         listen! There's got to be a fulcrum 
                         release! Look around!

                                     WILLIE (O.S.)
                         A what?!

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               Willie whines and frantically searches the wall. Insects are 
               crawling and jumping on her and she kicks at them!

                                     INDIANA (O.S.)
                         A fulcrum release lever!

                                     WILLIE
                         I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!

               INT. THE SPIKE CHAMBER

               Indiana and Short Round are backed against the wall and the 
               spikes are a foot away and moving in --

                                     INDIANA
                         Look around, Willie! There's got to 
                         be a lever hidden somewhere! Come 
                         on, you can do it!

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               Insects drop onto Willie from the ceiling and fly at her as 
               she flattens against the wall. Then her elbow hits something -- 
               a loose stone. She claws at it and it falls out of the wall 
               leaving a hole.

                                     WILLIE
                         There's a hole! I found a square 
                         hole!

                                     INDIANA (O.S.)
                         That's it -- the release lever -- 
                         look inside!

                                     WILLIE
                         I am -- it looks horrible!

               The hole is revolting: covered with squirming insects, it 
               also oozes some kind of glistening mucus.

                                     INDIANA (O.S.)
                         Reach inside!

               Willie moves her hand toward the nauseating hole then pulls 
               back.

                                     WILLIE
                         I can't, Indy! I can't!

               INT. THE SPIKE TUNNEL

               Indiana turns his head sideways and sucks in his breath, but 
               the deadly spikes are poking into his leather jacket now --

                                     INDIANA
                         The lever! Willie, do it! NOW!

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               Willie screams and jams her hand into the gross hole --

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!

                                     INDIANA (O.S.)
                         Willie!

               INT. THE SPIKE CHAMBER

               Short Round is frightened to death and crying --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Willie, help us! Hurry!

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               She hears Short Round crying and twists her hand in the 
               disgusting hole. Suddenly the door springs open! Willie pulls 
               her hand out and stares in horror -- her hand and arm are 
               covered with greenish slimy dung!

               INT. THE SPIKE CHAMBER

               The spikes suddenly retract, disappearing into the wall and 
               closing. Indy pulls Willie inside the chamber and the door 
               slams shut again. Willie dances around, yelling about the 
               hideous slime on her arm.

                                     WILLIE
                         Get is off me -- get it off!

               Indy helps her wipe it off. Willie falls back against the 
               door.

                                     WILLIE
                         You left me out there! What in the 
                         hell were you doing in here?! I want 
                         to leave this place right now!!

               She sees the same lever that Short Round pulled earlier and 
               grabs for it. Indiana dives and manages to stop her from 
               activating the spikes again.

                                     INDIANA
                         Not that one! We had enough of that 
                         one, thank you...

               He looks around and spots a small rock protruding from the 
               wall. Cautiously, praying that it won't activate another 
               booby trap, Indy pushes the rock.

               A large door opens on the other side of the chamber -- a 
               soft wind howls past outside the chamber.

               INT. THE WIND TUNNEL

               Indiana, Short Round and Willie exit the spike chamber and 
               head down a larger tunnel through which a roaring wind 
               intermittently blows, howling eerily like a note of gloomy 
               music.

               Indiana follows a curve in the tunnel and they see light 
               approaching. The wind howls another dramatic note which gales 
               past them as they reach the mouth of the tunnel.

               Indiana is joined by Willie and Short Round. They all stop 
               in astonishment at the sight below them:

               INT. THE TEMPLE OF DEATH

               As the camera pulls back, the mouth of the wind tunnel in 
               which they are standing becomes just a small hole overlooking 
               the staggering vastness of the incredible TEMPLE OF DEATH.

               The colossal subterranean temple has been carved out of a 
               solid mass of rock. A vaulting cathedral-like ceiling is 
               supported by rows of carved stone columns.

               Balconies overlook the temple floor. Pillared halls leading 
               to dark side chambers. Moving out of these chambers, hundreds 
               of faithful worshippers chant as they enter the temple.

               Mammoth stone statues of elephants, lions and demi-gods (half-
               man, half-animal monstrosities) loom above the swelling crowds 
               or worshippers.

               As the wind howls out of the tunnel high above the temple, 
               the worshippers chant in response to the strange tunnel music.

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               The moaning wind rushes past Indiana, Willie and Short Round 
               as they watch the mystery cult below bowing toward an enormous 
               altar at the far end of the temple.

               This altar is a platform jutting out from the stone wall of 
               the cavern. Separating the worshippers from this altar is a 
               wide crevasse out of which wisps of smoke rise occasionally.

               INT. THE ALTAR

               On the other side of the crevasse, evil-looking priests 
               materialize out of clouds of swirling smoke. The priests 
               carry smoke-billowing urns to a giant stone statue.

               Now, we see the hideous protectress of the temple, the 
               obscenely malevolent object of the cult's devotion: the 
               bloodthirsty goddess KALI!

               The red-eyed priests bow at the base of the statue and gaze 
               reverently at their KALI MA. Skulls surround her stone feet 
               carved serpents twist up her legs, while around her waist 
               there is a gruesome belt of human hands.

               Naked to the hips, Kali's hair falls about her four arms. In 
               her hand, she holds a sword, in the second the severed head 
               of a giant. With her other hands she encourages her 
               worshipers, who are chanting louder and louder!

               Kali's face is loathsome: her earrings are two corpses. Her 
               evil tongue extends out of her twisted mouth and what looks 
               like read blood flows over her long fangs and down her naked 
               breasts.

               INT. THE WIND TUNNEL

               Watching from the high opening, Willie looks disgusted.

                                     WILLIE
                         What is it...?

                                     INDIANA
                         It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're 
                         worshipping Kali, the goddess of 
                         Death and Destruction.

               INT. THE TEMPLE OF DEATH

               A huge drum sounds three times and the chanting stops. The 
               silence is chilling as another robed figure appears out of 
               the smoke on the altar.

               This is MOLA RAM, the High Priest of the Thugge cult. Mola 
               Ram's red-rimmed eyes glare from the sunken sockets in his 
               sinister face. Here is a man who looks as vile and diabolic 
               as the unholy goddess rising behind him.

               Up in the wind tunnel, Indy stares down at the High Priest 
               and realizes that is was Mola Ram he saw conferring with 
               Chattar Lal in the palace garden.

               As the drum booms three times more, Mola Ram lifts one arm 
               up from his emaciated body and suddenly there is a scream!

               All heads turn toward an unfortunate, struggling Indian begin 
               dragged out by priests. The man's face and body are wildly 
               painted. He screams again as he's tied onto a square iron 
               frame laying atop a large flat stone.

               Mola Ram steps forward to the stretched-out victim and the 
               Indian looks up into the High Priest's grotesque face --

               Suddenly Mola Ram's hand shoots out toward the man's chest - 
               and pierces it! The High Priests hand sinks into the victim's 
               writhing body and rips out his living heart!

               INT. THE WIND TUNNEL

               Willie covers her mouth --

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he 
                         killed him!

                                     INDIANA
                         No... the heart's still beating!

               INT. THE ALTAR

               Indeed, the bloody heart is still beating in Mola Ram's hand! 
               He lifts the heart into the air and the worshippers begin 
               the chant.

                                     THE MULTITUDE
                         Jai ma Kali, jai ma Kali!

               Stranger still, the sacrificial victim is still alive -- 
               there is no evidence of a gash on his chest, only a reddish 
               mark. The priests add chains to the iron frame and carry the 
               victim over toward a hoist hanging over the crevasse.

               The man thrashes about helplessly on the iron frame as it is 
               up ended and then lowered with the victim hanging face down --

               As the sacrificial victim looks down into the crevasse below -- 
               he screams -- and we see the molten lava bubbling crimson at 
               the bottom of the chasm!

               INT. THE WIND TUNNEL

               Willie closes her eyes but Indy and Short Round watch 
               horrified as the iron frame is lowered -- and the bloody 
               heart continues to beat in Mola Ram's hand -- and the molten 
               lava burns and flickers as the screaming victim is lowered 
               deeper into the crevasse.

               INT. THE TEMPLE

               The weird paint on the victim's face starts to smoke and 
               sizzle -- the man's skin blisters as he's lowered within 
               feet of the lava. His flesh smokes and he screams one last 
               time as his body bursts into flame.

               The iron frame sinks and submerges into the boiling fiery 
               lava.

               INT. THE ALTAR

               Above the crevasse, Mola Ram continues to hold the heart in 
               his hand -- the heart is smoking and bursts into flames -- 
               and disappears!

               INT. THE TEMPLE

               The iron frame is raised out of the lava -- the metal glows 
               like a branding iron, but there is no trace of the sacrificed 
               victim.

               INT. THE WIND TUNNEL

               As the wind howls again, Willie and Short Round look sickened 
               and appalled by the ceremony. Even Indy seems shaken by what 
               they are witnessing.

               Mola Ram raises both hands and his voice echoes strange 
               incantations. Behind him, three priests carry cloth-wrapped 
               objects toward the altar.

               INT. THE WIND TUNNEL

               Willie is crying and her voice is shocking as she turns away 
               from the hideous ritual --

                                     WILLIE
                         Let's go! Let's get out of here!

                                     INDIANA
                         Quiet!

               INT. THE ALTAR

               The priests reverently unwrap three conical pieces of 
               crystallized quartz. The place the three stones below the 
               statue of Kali and slowly the smoke around the altar swirls --

               The smoke is drawn to the three stones and they actually 
               start inhaling the spiraling smoke. The smoke disappears 
               into the stones and the air clears. Then the three stones 
               start to glow a haunting incandescent white.

               INT. THE WIND TUNNEL

               Short Round looks scared. Willie is still crying -- Indy 
               waits, horrified but fascinated.

                                     INDIANA
                         The village knew their rock was magic -- 
                         but they didn't know it was one of 
                         the lost Sankara Stones...

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Why they glow like that?

                                     INDIANA
                         Legend says that when the stones are 
                         brought together the diamonds inside 
                         of them will glow.

               Willie wipes her eyes and becomes more interested --

                                     WILLIE
                         Diamonds...?

               INT. THE ALTAR

               The Sankara Stones shimmer brightly, and inside the 
               crystallized quartz, the enormous sparkling diamonds of legend 
               are now revealed.

               Mola Ram stands facing Kali with his arms outstretched and 
               kneels and bows and then walks off the altar and disappears.

               INT. THE WIND TUNNEL

               Indiana sees the worshippers below start to leave the temple. 
               He looks at Willie and Short Round.

                                     INDIANA
                         Okay -- now listen -- you wait here 
                         and keep quiet. Shorty, keep an eye 
                         on her.

               Short Round nods and hands Indy his bullwhip and shoulder 
               bag. Willie sees Indiana peering down at the sheer drop below 
               the mouth of the wind tunnel.

                                     WILLIE
                         Wait -- what're you doing?

                                     INDIANA
                         I'm going down.

                                     WILLIE
                         Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!

                                     INDIANA
                         I'm not leaving without those stones.

                                     WILLIE
                         You're gonna get killed chasing after 
                         your damn fortune and glory!

                                     INDIANA
                              (looking at her)
                         Maybe... someday.
                              (smiling)
                         Not today.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         I keep my eye peeled, Indy.

               Indiana nods and looks down at the now empty temple. Then he 
               slips down from the mouth of the wind tunnel.

               INT. THE TEMPLE WALL

               Indiana skillfully climbs down an enormous temple column -- 
               finding footholds on stone cobras, carved lions and the stone 
               breasts of dancing girls. Slowly, he makes his way down and 
               swings across a balcony.

               INT. THE BALCONY

               Indiana walks quietly along the balcony overlooking the 
               temple. He stops -- between him and the altar is the crevasse 
               with the lava bubbling fire at the bottom.

               Indiana looks across the gulf and sees another column near 
               the altar at the top of which stone elephants are perched. 
               Indy curls his whip and suddenly lets it fly --

               The whip cracks and its end wraps tightly around the tusk of 
               one of the stone elephants. From the balcony, Indy tugs the 
               whip taut, takes a breath and runs --

               INT. THE CREVASSE

               Indiana leaps and swings out on the whip, arching down and 
               up, over the chasm of fiery lava in a spectacular curving 
               jump!

               INT. THE LATAR

               Indy lands on his feet and turns to release the whip. Short 
               Round waves to Indy that the coast is clear. Indy snaps the 
               whip -- it releases from the elephant tusk and drops.

               Recurling the whip, Indy attaches it to his belt and moves 
               toward the towering statue of Kali. The three Sankara stones 
               start to glow and Indiana approaches them cautiously.

               Reaching the stones, Indy's face is lighted by them. He 
               notices that one of them (the stone from Mayapore village) 
               has strange lines painted across it.

               Suspiciously, Indy touches the stone, but it doesn't burn. 
               He lifts it carefully and peers into it. The enormous diamond 
               sparkles inside. He places the stone in his shoulder bag and 
               reaches for the others.

               INT. THE WIND TUNNEL

               Short Round and Willie watch apprehensively as Indiana bags 
               the three stones.

               INT. THE ALTAR

               Indiana backs away and looks up at the horrific statue of 
               Kali. It seems to be watching him. He turns and is about to 
               go when he hears something --

               It sounds like a voice and Indy is afraid to turn -- could 
               it be Kali? The he hears other noises echoing and turns 
               slowly. Realizing the sounds are coming from behind the altar, 
               Indy moves around it toward the back.

               INT. THE WIND TUNNEL

               Short Round and Willie are mystified as they see Indiana 
               disappear behind the altar.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh hell, where's he going?

               Short Round looks worried. Then the wind rushes past them 
               quickly and howls its somber musical note. However, the wind 
               sounds different this time, its tone quavering slightly.

               Short Round is puzzled and looks around. He freezes when he 
               sees two shadowy figures coming down the tunnel toward them -- 
               the bodies causing the tone of the wind to shift eerily --

               Willie notices Short Round pulling a dagger from his belt --

                                     WILLIE
                         What're you -- ?

               Suddenly she turns and screams as two huge Thuggee guards 
               rush at them! One grabs at Short Round but the kid slashes 
               the guard's hand with his dagger.

               Willie tries to get past the other guard, but he snatches 
               her by the arm and pulls her toward him -- from her training 
               at the College of Hard Knocks, Willie successfully knees the 
               big man in the balls.

                                     WILLIE
                         Keep your paws off, letch!

               The man groans and sinks to his knees. Willie sees that Short 
               Round is in trouble. She runs over, leaps onto the back of 
               the other guard and starts ripping his hair out.

               Short Round picks up his fallen dagger. The big guard lurches 
               backwards and smashes Willie into the rocky wall of the 
               tunnel. Willie falls to the floor.

               Short Round approaches, holding the man at bay with his 
               dagger. Willie turns as the other guard, the one she kneed, 
               crawls toward her -- Willie scoops up some dirt and throws 
               it. The man claws at his eyes and Willie jumps up.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Run Willie!

               Willie starts to run and Short Round backs away, keeping the 
               guard at a distance with his dagger. Suddenly the guard cries 
               out in Hindi and dives at Short Round.

               Panicking, Shorty tries to run after Willie -- but he's 
               tripped. The guard has Short Round by the foot and drags him 
               back. Willie looks around and stops running. She sees Short 
               Round is caught.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         No! Run! Go get help!

               Willie hesitates, then runs down the tunnel. Meanwhile, a 
               mammoth hand clutches Short Round's throat -- the giant guard 
               lifts Shorty completely off the ground and the kid looks 
               terrified and helpless as he dangles in the air...

               INT. CHAMBER BEHIND ALTAR

               Indiana enters the dark chamber behind the altar. The only 
               illumination is the back-light streaming around the 
               silhouetted statue of Kali.

               Indy slowly crosses a narrow stone bridge and moves toward a 
               cylindrical shaft of light rising up from what appears to be 
               an enormous hole.

               Indy hears voices and the clink of metal against rock as he 
               continues forward. The ground is dark in front of the large 
               hole. He edges toward the precipice and the light rising up 
               illuminates the look of shock on his face as he peers down 
               into Hell...

               INT. THE THUGGEE MINES

               Indy looks into a deep pit around which concentric paths 
               leads off into numerous narrow tunnels. Crawling out of these 
               burrows, scrawny children drag sacks of dirt and rock. Other 
               hollow-eyed children pull these sacks to mine cars waiting 
               on rails.

               Straining to lift the rocks into the mine cars, several of 
               the children slip and fall. Bare-chested Thuggee guards shout 
               at the enslaved children and kick those who've fallen.

               For these children there would seem to be only one hope -- 
               death -- an end to their travail.

               Indiana edges around the hole, looking into the ghastly mine 
               and feeling as if he's discovered an inferno of misery as 
               grotesque as Dante's.

               Indy shifts the bag of stones on his shoulder. He hesitates 
               and considers his choice: he has the Sankara Stones and can 
               leave with them now...

               But Indy hears the pleading cries of one child and peers 
               down to see a burly Thuggee guard beating the pitiful little 
               slave. Indy gets angrier and angrier as he watches.

               He finally steps over the grabs a boulder. He lifts it and 
               flings it down into the mine --

               INT. THE MINE

               We see Indiana above and the boulder hurtling down -- it 
               crashes onto the head of the Thuggee guard who hits the ground 
               like a sack of cement!

               INT. THE CHAMBER

               Indy sees the startled slave children looking up at him in 
               shock. He smiles victoriously at the Thuggees below who've 
               run over to see what happened.

               Indy's smile seems to fade as his anger turns to surprise as 
               he feels something unnerving:

               Dirt is crumbling away from the rim of the hole, a small 
               landslide starting beneath his feet. Suddenly the floor gives 
               way and Indy slips!

               The entire rim of the hole shears off and Indy topples with 
               it and plunges down into the mine toward the assembled guards 
               who scatter -- Indy yells as he falls and it echoes...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A CELL - NIGHT

               Indiana's yell continues to echo -- his head jerks suddenly -- 
               Indy jolts awake as if coming out of a nightmare, awakened 
               by his own reverberating shout.

               Indy is lying on the rocky floor of a dark cave/cell. He 
               lifts his hands and discovers that they are chained. In the 
               murky light, he sees Short Round sitting in chains across 
               the cell.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy -- you knocked out when you 
                         fall. You okay?

               Indiana nods groggily. He sees a young slave worker in rags 
               sitting near Short Round. Through the iron bars of the cell, 
               Indy sees the children slaving in the mine tunnels.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                              (indicating the kid)
                         This is Nainsukh -- from the village. 
                         They bring him here to dig in the 
                         mines.

                                     INDIANA
                         Why?

                                     NAINSUKH
                         Children are small -- we can work in 
                         tunnels. Now I am too old.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         What they do to you now?

                                     NAINSUKH
                         I pray to Shiva -- let me die. But I 
                         do not. Now -- now the evil of Kali 
                         take me.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         How?

                                     NAINSUKH
                         They will make me drink blood of 
                         Kali. Then I fall into black sleep 
                         of Kali Ma...

                                     INDIANA
                         What is that?

                                     NAINSUKH
                         I become like them. I believe -- not 
                         like in nightmare. You drink the 
                         blood, you not wake up from nightmare 
                         of Kali Ma.

               There's a noise and they see two guards and a priest outside 
               the cell. Nainsukh cowers in the darkness at the back of the 
               cell, like a trapped animal awaiting the inevitable.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

               Indiana and Short Round are pushed down a tunnel by guards. 
               They are stopped at a door and shoved inside.

               INT. MOLA RAM'S CHAMBER

               Indiana and Short Round stumble into the chamber. It is a 
               terrifying gallery of occult yantras, ritualistic statues 
               and grisly icons of the evil Thuggee sect.

               Grotesque statues of Kali's baleful minions line the walls. 
               In a corner, there is another statue of Kali herself, draped 
               with flowers, necklaces of real human skills and slithering 
               belts of live snakes.

               Fresh blood has been splashed over the statue and at its 
               base are the three Sankara Stones recovered from Indiana. 
               Mola Ram sits in a yoga position near the statue of Kali.

               Mola Ram opens his eyes and he sees Indiana and Short Round 
               standing in chains before him.

                                     MOLA RAM
                         You were caught trying to steal the 
                         Sankara Stones.

                                     INDIANA
                              (shrugging)
                         Nobody's perfect. The way I heard 
                         it, you stole one of them from a 
                         small village.

               Mola Ram stands and gazes transfixed at the stones glowing 
               on the altar.

                                     MOLA RAM
                         There were five stones in the 
                         beginning. Over the centuries they 
                         were dispersed by wars, sold off by 
                         thieves like you...

                                     INDIANA
                         Two are still missing.

                                     MOLA RAM
                         No. They are here -- somewhere. A 
                         century ago when the British raided 
                         this temple and butchered my people, 
                         a loyal priest hid the last two stones 
                         down here in the catacombs.

                                     INDIANA
                         That's what you've got these children -- 
                         these slaves digging for?

                                     MOLA RAM
                         They dig for the gems to support our 
                         cause. They also search for the last 
                         two stones. Soon we will have all 
                         five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees 
                         will be all powerful!

                                     INDIANA
                         Nobody can say you don't have a vivid 
                         imagination.

                                     MOLA RAM
                         You do not believe me? You will, Dr. 
                         Jones. You will become a true 
                         believer.

               The door opens and Mola Ram bows slightly as the little 
               Maharajah enters. Indy looks surprised and Short Round tenses.

                                     MOLA RAM
                         Your Highness will witness the thief's 
                         conversion.

               Mola Ram nods and two guards grab Indy. They drag him 
               struggling to a rock and chain him to it. Short Round scuffles 
               as he's pulled aside to watch.

               Remembering the High Priest's earlier open-heart surgery, 
               Indiana looks worried as Mola Ram approaches him --

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         You will not suffer. I recently became 
                         of age and tasted the blood of Kali.

               Now the young initiate comes forward and Indiana looks 
               startled -- it's Nainsukh. He is wearing robes and his eyes 
               are glowing strangely. Nainsukh hands Mola Ram a hollow human 
               skull full of blood!

               The guards hold Indiana's head back and force his mouth open. 
               Mola Ram tips the skull and blood spills out of its death-
               grinning jaws and flows into Indiana's mouth. Indy gags --

               Suddenly he spits the blood, spraying Mola Ram and the little 
               Maharajah. Looking at his blood-splattered clothes, the 
               Maharajah is furious.

                                     MOLA RAM
                         Hold him!

               The little prince's eyes glow angrily and he hisses at Indy --

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         You will learn to obey because you 
                         are powerless!

               The little Maharajah pulls a small kryta from his robes -- 
               Indy sees that the doll has been crudely fashioned to resemble 
               him.

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         I control you now!

               The Maharajah turns and sticks the doll into a flaming urn. 
               Indiana suddenly cries out and twists in pain as he is burned! 
               The little prince smiles evilly and puts the doll back into 
               his robes.

               Then he goes over to where Indy's whip and bag have been 
               laid. He grabs the bullwhip.

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         You told me that a whip could be an 
                         enemy to its owner. We shall see! 
                         Turn him over!

               As the guards turn Indy face down, they rip off his jacket 
               and chain his hands to the rock. The Maharajah uncurls the 
               whip -- he notices Short Round smiling snidely --

               Suddenly the Maharajah cracks the whip -- it lashes out and 
               cuts into Short Round's shoulder. Blood appears and Short 
               Round looks stunned by the lash and by the fact the Maharajah 
               knows who to use the whip.

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         As Dr. Jones suggested, I have been 
                         practicing.

               The little Maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again. Indiana 
               jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open 
               his flesh. The Maharajah lashes again and again -- blood 
               spurts across Indy's tattered shirt.

               As the whipping continues, Short Round jumps as if he is 
               also being beaten. His eyes fill with tears as he watches 
               Indy suffer.

               Finally, the little Maharajah lets the whip fall limp. As 
               the Maharajah approaches Indy, Short Round lunges as him 
               angrily but the guards restrain him.

               Indiana groans as he's turned over. Blood trickles from his 
               mouth and he stares up hatefully at Mola Ram.

                                     MOLA RAM
                         The British in India will be 
                         slaughtered. Then we will over-run 
                         the Moslems and force their "Allah" 
                         to bow to Kali.

               Mola Ram is once again given the human skull by a priest and 
               he lifts it toward Indy's face --

                                     MOLA RAM
                         And then the Hebrew God will fall 
                         and finally the Christian God will 
                         be cast down and forgotten.

               Indy's head is held back and Mola Ram spills the blood -- it 
               flows out of the mouth of the skull into Indy's mouth.

                                     MOLA RAM
                         Soon Kali Ma will rule the world!

               Indy's eyes look horrified as the blood flows from the skull 
               down his choking throat -- some of the blood spills and falls 
               to the floor --

               We see the very earth trembling as the evil spreads -- a 
               fissure appears beneath Indy's feet and a small line of 
               crimson lava oozes out and smiles evilly across the floor...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WILLIE'S SUITE - NIGHT

               Diaphanous curtains billow silently into the moonlighted 
               room. Two exotic birds sit on a golden perch, their eyes 
               clicking watchfully. Suddenly the birds shriek and flap away --

               Willie stumbles through the secret door and falls into the 
               room. Insects cover her and she whimpers as she knocks them 
               off. She manages to stagger to her feet and she heads for 
               the door.

               INT. THE PALACE - NIGHT

               Willie rushes out of her room and runs through the deserted 
               palace looking for help. She flies down the moonlit corridors, 
               past the huge wall paintings.

               She stops by a courtyard and calls out desperately, but there 
               is no one around. She backs away down a hallway and then 
               jumps -- seeing something in a mirror: a face looms behind 
               her and she screams!

               Willie whirls and sees Chattar Lal, the Prime Minister, 
               approaching her.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh my God, you scared me! Listen, 
                         you've got to help. We found this 
                         tunnel --

               Captain Blumburtt comes around a corner and interrupts --

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                              (to Chattar Lal)
                         Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- 
                         my troops are leaving at dawn if you 
                         want us to escort you to Delhi --

                                     WILLIE
                         No -- you can't go! Something awful's 
                         happened. They've got Short Round 
                         and I think Indy's been --

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                         What?

                                     WILLIE
                         We found a tunnel that leads to a 
                         temple below the palace! Please, 
                         come with me, I'll show you!

               The two men exchange dubious looks. Willie grabs Blumburtt 
               by the arm and they start down the hall.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         Miss Scott, you're not making any 
                         sense.

                                     WILLIE
                         I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw 
                         horrible things down there -- they 
                         had a human sacrifice and they ripped 
                         a man's heart out!

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                         Who?

                                     WILLIE
                         It's some kind of cult! And they've 
                         got the sacred stones that Indy was 
                         searching for.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         I sense the fumes of opium in all 
                         this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up 
                         the habit in Shanghai.

                                     WILLIE
                         What're you talking about -- I'm not 
                         a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show 
                         you!

               INT. WILLIE'S SUITE

               She leads them into her suite. Willie points to the dark 
               opening in the wall. Blumburtt picks up an oil lamp and holds 
               it toward the opening -- suddenly he jumps back as Indiana 
               emerges!

                                     INDIANA
                              (smiling faintly)
                         What're we playing, hid and seek?

               They're all startled. Willie looks relieved and rushes over 
               to Indy and puts her arms around him.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh, Indy, you got away! Tell them 
                         what happened, they won't believe me --

               He puts his arms around her and feels her trembling from 
               fear and anger. He walks her to the bed and helps her sit 
               down --

                                     INDIANA
                         It's okay. You're all right now.

                                     WILLIE
                         They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm 
                         not, Indy. Please -- help me ...

               The awful events have taken their toll and Willie covers her 
               face and cries like a scared kid. Indy gets her to lie down 
               on the bed. He sits beside her and smiles and touches her 
               hair --

                                     INDIANA
                         Hey, I thought you were supposed to 
                         be a real trooper. Willie?

               He wipes the tears from her face and she holds his hand --

                                     WILLIE
                              (quietly)
                         What?

                                     INDIANA
                         You've got to go to sleep now.

                                     WILLIE
                              (softly)
                         I want to go home...

                                     INDIANA
                         I don't blame you... this hasn't 
                         been what you'd call a fun vacation...

               She smiles a little despite herself and he touches her cheek. 
               He eyes are already closing and he stands up.

               A servant is entering the suite to take care of Willie. She 
               covers her with a blanket and start dropping the mosquito 
               netting as Indy walks off toward the verandah with Blumburtt 
               and Chattar Lal.

               EXT. THE VERANDAH - DAWN

               The first light is breaking over the mountain peaks. Coming 
               out onto the verandah, Indy and the other two men see the 
               cavalry troops breaking camp below and readying their horses 
               and trucks.

                                     INDIANA
                         I've spent by life crawling around 
                         in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't 
                         have let somebody like Willie go in 
                         there with me.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                         Miss Scott panicked?

                                     INDIANA
                         When she saw the insects she passed 
                         out cold. I carried her back to her 
                         room. She was sleeping when I re-
                         entered the tunnel to look around.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         As she slept, she undoubtedly had 
                         nightmares.

               Indiana looks at him and nods.

                                     INDIANA
                         Then she must have run out of the 
                         room and you found her.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                         Did you discover anything in that 
                         tunnel, Dr. Jones?

               Indiana stares into the rising sun.

                                     INDIANA
                         Nothing. Just a dead end. That 
                         tunnel's been deserted for years.

               A sergeant-major shouts up to Blumburtt that the troops are 
               ready.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                         Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report 
                         will duly note that we found nothing 
                         unusual here in Pankot.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         I'm sure that will please the 
                         Maharajah, Captain.

                                     CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                              (to Indiana)
                         As I said before, we'd be happy to 
                         escort you to Delhi.

                                     INDIANA
                         Thanks, but I don't think Willie is 
                         ready to travel yet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PALACE ROAD - MORNING

               Dust swirls as the British cavalry moves off with their 
               Highland Pipers at the head playing a military bagpipe tune. 
               Capt. Blumburtt comes out of the palace and gets into an 
               open car.

               Blumburtt's car moves off behind the cavalry and then the 
               supply trucks follow.

               INT. WILLIE'S SUITE

               The whine of the bagpipes is eerily muted in the dark room. 
               Through the gently swaying mosquito netting, we see Willie 
               asleep on the bed.

               Then through her side of the gauzy netting, we see the door 
               opening across the room. Indiana enters quietly and moves 
               toward the bed, his eyes fixed on Willie's sleeping body.

               Indy sits down on the bed slowly. Willie turns in her sleep 
               and opens her eyes. Through the mosquito netting she sees 
               Indy sitting with his back to her.

                                     WILLIE
                         Indy? Did you talk to them?

                                     INDIANA
                         Yes.

                                     WILLIE
                         So now they believe me.

                                     INDIANA
                         Yes, they believe you.

               Indiana speaks in a strange monotone.

                                     WILLIE
                         Then they'll send the soldiers down 
                         into the temple...

               Willie looks at Indiana's back and continues quietly.

                                     WILLIE
                         I was scared to death last night 
                         when I thought they were going to 
                         kill you.

                                     INDIANA
                         No... they won't kill me.

                                     WILLIE
                              (smiling faintly)
                         You know you've been nothing but 
                         trouble since I hooked up with you --
                         but I have to admit I'd miss you if 
                         I lost you...

               Now Indiana starts to turn slowly.

                                     INDIANA
                         You won't lose me, Willie...

               She sees him turn and his face slowly comes toward the 
               mosquito netting -- his face pushes into the netting and 
               Willie looks stunned as Indy's mouth opens --

               He starts hissing grotesquely, smoke billows out of his mouth 
               and the mosquito netting BURNS OPEN to expose his terrifying 
               face moving toward Willie --

               She is frozen with fear and unable to utter a sound as Indy's 
               malevolent face looms at her -- and then she notices his 
               eyes -- his eyes glowing a hellish luminescent yellow!

               Willie SCREAMS!!

               She suddenly bolts from the bed and tries to run -- Indiana 
               goes into a rage, ripping the mosquito netting from the bed 
               as he follows her.

                                     INDIANA
                         No! I've found it -- you can't -- 
                         Kali knows!

               Willie tries the door but it's locked. She sees Indiana moving 
               toward her ranting incoherently as he smashes a vase out of 
               his way --

                                     INDIANA
                         -- been too many lies - there's no 
                         god's heaven - just - the horror! 
                         I've seen it - life preying on life!

               Willie cowers in a corner, horrified by the transformation 
               she sees in Indiana. Shouting and pacing Indy holds his head 
               against the pain of his terrible thoughts --

                                     INDIANA
                         -- rivers -- destroying mountains -- 
                         a comet in space -- exploding!
                              (holding his head)
                         Aaahh! -- the screams -- pitiful 
                         people -- their pain -- the hate -- 
                         and greed -- always greed!

               The light throws his shadow over Willie -- a giant shadow 
               floating back and forth over her as she cries in the corner, 
               unable to fight the evil devouring Indiana.

                                     INDIANA
                         -- but I've found -- Kali's touch! 
                         Death -- no more lies -- the death 
                         I've been searching for!
                              (shouting)
                         Quit crying! She can hear you -- 
                         Kali knows fear -- don't you 
                         understand -- Kali is freedom!

               Indiana stops pacing and Willie freezes in terror. Now a 
               bizarre yellow light wipes across the room. Indiana turns 
               and watches silently as two Thuggee guards emerge from a 
               secret doorway that's opened --

               The shadows of the Thuggee guards loom over Willie and she 
               SCREAMS again!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE TEMPLE OF DEATH - DAY

               A sea of frightening faces once again intones the horrible 
               sacrificial chant. Among the worshippers, the little Maharajah 
               sits on a raised platform. Like the other believers, he stares 
               across the crevasse at the altar of Kali Ma.

               The wailing wind howls out of the high tunnel and the 
               terrifying chanting reaches a fever pitch.

               INT. THE TEMPLE ALTAR

               And once again the three sacred Sankara Stones glow magically. 
               Mola Ram materializes evilly amidst the swirling smoke and 
               he begins chanting in Sanskrit.

               Beside the altar, half-clad female acolytes pass in front of 
               the robed priests -- with their fingers the women paint two 
               white lines across the priests' foreheads.

               An acolyte moves in front of Chattar Lal -- the Prime Minister 
               is now dressed in robes. As the devotional markings are 
               painted on his forehead, Chattar Lal translates the High 
               Priest's speech to Indiana who stands next to him.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         Mola Ram is telling the faithful of 
                         out victory. He says the British 
                         have left the palace, which proves 
                         Kali Ma's new power.

                                     INDIANA
                         Yes, I understand.

               Indiana bows his head to receive the mystical markings. He 
               listens to Mola Ram's rantings -- Indy's eyes are ominously 
               vacant as he stares up at the hideous statue of Kali.

               INT. MINE TUNNELS - DAY

               Beneath the temple, down in the bowels of the mountain, the 
               pitiful children dig at the earth with their fingers. A FAT 
               GUARD slouches down the tunnel, flogging malingerers with a 
               leather strap.

               Short Round sweats next to the others, clawing at the rocks, 
               doomed to work with them now in their search for the last 
               two Sankara Stones.

               The leather strap suddenly flays Short Round's back and he 
               barely manages not to scream out in pain. The fat guard passes -- 
               Short Round and the other kids pull a large rock which 
               suddenly comes loose out of the wall!

               They fall back and see they've exposed a vein of molten lava! 
               Hearing their shouts, the fat guard returns -- yelling at 
               their stupidity, he whips them and shoves them aside brutally.

               Short Round see the fat guard's eyes glowing fiercely in 
               anger. Suddenly the fissure shoots out steam and spews some 
               molten lava over the guard's legs.

               The guard screams and falls to the ground, thrashing about, 
               trying to kick the searing lava off his smoking flesh.

               As the other kids cower, Short Round's humane instincts cause 
               him to jump forward to help the guard who moments earlier 
               was beating him --

               Short Round tosses dirt on the guard's legs and grabs a gunny 
               sack and starts rubbing the lava off. Shorty notices something 
               strange:

               The guard's eyes, which were glowing yellow before, are now 
               dimming and returning to normal. The moaning guard looks at 
               Shorty thankfully and then looks around as if waking from a 
               nightmare --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                              (to another slave kid)
                         His eyes -- they go out.

               Other guards appear and lift the guard -- suddenly he starts 
               struggling against the guards not wanting to return to the 
               nightmare of Kali --

                                     FAT GUARD
                              (as he's dragged away)
                         No! NO!

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         The pain -- the pain makes him wake 
                         up!
                              (thinking quickly)
                         Indy! I can make Indy wake up!

               But the other guards push and beat the children back to work. 
               Short Round is shoved against a wall and groans -- he reaches 
               over and grabs a large rock, lifting it defiantly --

               But rather than heaving it at the guard, Short Round smashes 
               the rock down on the leg chains binding him to the other 
               children. Shorty beats at the chain with the rock, determined 
               to escape.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy!

               INT. THE TEMPLE OF DEATH

               The wind moans and joins Mola Ram's voice echoing maniacally 
               over the multitude gathered in the enormous temple. On his 
               throne, the little Maharajah listens transfixed.

               INT. THE ALTAR

               Chattar Lal watches Indiana staring hypnotically at the High 
               Priest as he speaks --

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         You understand what he tells us?

                                     INDIANA
                         Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, 
                         and we must pledge our devotion by 
                         worshipping her with an offering of 
                         flesh and blood!

               Suddenly there is a heart-rending scream of terror and the 
               priests draft forward the next sacrificial victim --

               Indiana's glowing eyes watch emotionlessly as Willie is 
               brought out. Dressed in a Rajput maiden's outfit, Willie has 
               been jeweled and draped with flowers -- a strange contrast 
               as she struggles desperately.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                         Your friend has seen and she has 
                         heard -- now she will not talk.

               As Willie is dragged past she sees Indy and calls to him --

                                     WILLIE
                         Indy! Help me! Indy?!

               Willie is shocked seeing that Indiana remains impassive and 
               uncaring as she's dragged to her death.

                                     CHATTAR LAL
                              (to Indy)
                         This will prove your devotion to 
                         Kali.

               Indiana looks away from Willie's terrified face and stares 
               up adoringly at the monstrous statue of his goddess Kali.

               INT. THE MINE

               In the dark tunnel, a rock smashes down onto a chain -- and 
               breaks it! Short Round is exhausted. He looks around furtively 
               and sees a guard approaching.

               Short Round takes a chance -- he dives and rolls across the 
               tunnel. He ducks behind a mine car full of rocks being pushed 
               out by two chained children.

               The guard lumbers past unsuspectingly as Short Round makes 
               his escape using the moving mine car as cover.

               INT. THE ALTAR

               Up in the temple, Willie continues to struggle as her legs 
               are strapped to the iron sacrificial frame. Chattar Lal grabs 
               her hand and ties it down. Willie's free hand reaches out 
               imploringly toward Indiana --

                                     WILLIE
                              (hoarsely)
                         Please, God, don't let them do this 
                         to me -- help me, Indy!

               He reaches out slowly and Willie grabs his hand tightly. 
               Indy looks into her eyes and then stares at her hand -- and 
               slowly lifts it and starts tying it to the iron frame.

                                     WILLIE
                         No -- no!

               Willie cries is disbelief as Indiana calmly betrays her.

               INT. THE MINES BELOW

               Short Round races up a tunnel and then flattens himself behind 
               a corner. He peers anxiously into a large craven and sees 
               two guards walking away.

               When the coast is clear, Short Round darts across the cavern 
               to a long wooden ladder tilted up against a wall. Short Round 
               looks up the high ladder and sees a kid with a sack of rocks 
               descending from a burrow-hole half-way up the wall.

               The exhausted kid nearly collapses at the bottom -- then 
               jumps seeing Short Round. Shorty motions for him to keep 
               quiet. Amazed, the kid watches Short Round scramble up the 
               ladder. Shorty continues until he is high above the floor.

               Dirty faces stare out of the high burrow as Short Round stops 
               climbing. The kids are astonished as Short Round suddenly 
               grunts and kicks the ladder away from the wall!

               The high ladder falls in an arc and what seem like sure 
               suicide slowly resembles a mini-Indiana Jones stunt as Short 
               Round swings to the other side of the falling ladder --

               Short Round holds on for dear life as the ladder crashes 
               against the opposite cavern wall -- giving Short Round access 
               to the roof-hole that leads up to the temple!

               Short Round scurries up the ladder and pulls himself up into 
               the chamber behind the altar. He looks at the light flaring 
               around the statue of Kali --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy!

               INT. THE TEMPLE OF DEATH

               Chains clank and gears grind as the sacrificial frame is 
               raised over the crevasse. Stretched out on it, Willie looks 
               horrified as she hangs suspended face down above the boiling 
               lava!

               The frame and victim descend slowly into the crevasse and 
               the crowd around the little Maharajah chants louder.

               INT. THE REAR CHAMBER

               Short Round dashes across the dark chamber behind the altar. 
               He peers out and sees Willie disappearing into the crevasse! 
               He sees Indiana watching impassively --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         No -- Indy -- wake up!

               Then Shorty sees a flaming torch hanging on a wall bracket 
               and he has an idea.

               INT. THE ALTAR

               Short Round suddenly darts out onto the altar and Mola Ram 
               sees him and yells. Several priests grab for Shorty. He eludes 
               the first priest, smashes the second in the stomach with his 
               head, and runs like a little quarterback toward the fiery 
               torch --

               Short Round snatches the torch from the wall and charges 
               toward Indiana. Seeing him coming, Indy's eyes start glowing 
               yellow and when Short Round runs up to him, Indiana suddenly 
               swings and backhands the little guy brutally across the face!

               The torch flies out of Shorty's hand as he's knocked against 
               at wall by Indy's vicious blow -- Short Round wipes a little 
               blood from his chin and stares at his hero in wounded 
               disbelief.

               Chattar Lal watches approvingly -- a priest moves toward 
               Shorty. Chattar Lal looks back toward the crevasse.

               Willie hangs on the lowering frame, heat waves rising up now 
               to scald her skin and she chokes as the sulfuric air burns 
               her lungs!

               Meanwhile Short Round is crawling backwards across the floor 
               with a look of terror on his face -- Indiana stalks him, 
               hissing, snarling, his eyes glowing --

               Short Round springs to his feet and tries to run -- Indy 
               grabs him and pulls him -- Shorty's hand grabs for another 
               wall torch and just manages to yank it free!

               Indiana spins Short Round and clutches his throat. As Indy 
               strangles him, Short Round struggles and finally jams the 
               torch into Indy's side. The fiery torch burns Indy, smoking 
               as it sears his flesh, and he yells in pain.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Wake up! It's just a nightmare, Indy! 
                         Wake up, please Indy!

               Indiana writhes in pain and Short Round sees the evil yellow 
               glow in Indy's eyes getting dimmer and finally going out. 
               Now it seems like the old Indiana staring at him --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy, you back?

               Suddenly a priest grabs Short Round and pulls him off Indiana.

                                     INDIANA
                         No! Give him to me!

               Short Round is frightened as Indy grabs him from the priest. 
               Indy lifts Short Round into the air --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         No, Indy, no!

               He sets Short Round down on the brink of the crevasse an 
               inch from doom. Shorty looks down at the lava and is 
               terrified. Indiana finally flashes him a quick smile and 
               winks!

               Then Indiana whirls and punches the priest in the face! Short 
               Round cheers, realizing that Indiana is back.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         We got to help Willie!

               Indiana springs into action, stopping another priest with a 
               quick punch in the stomach. Then he rushes over to the 
               crankwheel and pulley platform. Indy jumps onto it, yanking 
               one priest off who spills onto the floor.

               A second priest, who works the controls lowering the 
               sacrificial frame, sees Indy and releases the crankwheel.

               Down in the crevasse, Willie screams as the iron frame 
               suddenly plummets toward the fulminating lava!

               On the platform, the priest lunges at Indiana -- Indy uses 
               the man's own momentum to throw him over his head. Indy then 
               dives for the crankwheel and manages to stop it --

               Down in the crevasse, the frame jolts to a stop only yards 
               above the spumes of fiery lava. The heat is so intense now 
               that Willie's clothes start smoking and she passes out... On 
               the platform above, Indiana cranks furiously, raising the 
               sacrificial frame.

               INT. THE TEMPLE

               The chanting stops at the Kali worshippers notice the battle 
               on the altar. The little Maharajah looks concerned and leaves, 
               shoving through the crowd behind his bodyguards.

               INT. THE ALTAR

               Mola Ram shouts at his priests and another one of them runs 
               toward Indy on the platform. Short Round dives and tackles 
               the priest.

               Chattar Lal finally leaps onto the crankwheel platform and 
               Indy sees him pull a dagger. He slashes at Indiana and Indy 
               has to let go of the crankwheel -- the gears scream and the 
               chains screech!

               Below in the crevasse, the iron frame plunges again toward 
               the crimson lava!

               On the platform, Indy hears the frame lowering and looks 
               panicked. Chattar Lal slashes again with the dagger -- keeping 
               Indy away from the cogwheel mechanism --

               Indy suddenly kicks the dagger from Chattar Lal's hand slugs 
               him in the stomach and dives toward the cogwheel mechanism. 
               He grabs a iron rod and throws it into the gears --

               The gears mangle the iron rod but finally grind to a stop. 
               Indiana grabs the crankwheel and starts winding it up 
               furiously.

               Meanwhile, Short Round jumps onto the platform with Indy and 
               grabs a long wrench. He starts swinging the wrench, keeping 
               the last priests off the platform.

               The sacrificial frame finally rises up into view and Indiana 
               grabs it and swings it over onto the platform. He looks at 
               Willie anxiously as he releases her bindings --

               Willie moans and moves her head. Indy pulls her off the frame 
               and she starts coughing. Gasping for breath, Willie revives 
               as fresh air flows into her lungs.

               Finally Willie opens her eyes and she sees Indiana. Then she 
               notices something else and manages to cry out hoarsely.

                                     WILLIE
                         Look out -- !

               Chattar Lal grabs a pistol from an unconscious guard and 
               Indiana whirls to see him pointing it -- Indy kicks the gun 
               from his hand and suddenly Chattar Lal starts shouting in a 
               terrifying voice --

               Chattar Lal's eyes glow as he lunges suicidally at Indiana, 
               attempting to take Indy with him as he dives from the 
               platform!

               Crashing into Indy, Chattar Lal knocks both of them back 
               onto the sacrificial frame which swings out over the crevasse --

               Indy manages to dive off the frame just in time. He grabs 
               hold of the platform as the crankwheel screams and the frame 
               falls!

               Looking up from the depths of the crevasse, we see the frame 
               with Chattar Lal on it plummeting downward into the sulfurous 
               smoke! The frame finally crashes, splashing into the molten 
               lava.

               Chattar Lal's body explodes in a flame firefly -- his flesh 
               is broiled off in an instant -- we glimpse a skeleton 
               momentarily -- and then all is consumed and obliterated by 
               the blazing lava.

               Indy and Willie scramble over to Short Round who jumps off 
               the platform and they follow him across the altar.

               Indy sees Mola Ram quickly collecting the sacred Sankara 
               Stones. Indiana rushes over and spins Mola Ram around --

               He slugs the High Priest in the face and Mola Ram keels over 
               backwards against the statue of Kali. Short Round helps stuff 
               the Sankara Stones into Indiana's shoulder bag.

               INT. THE REAR CHAMBER

               Short Round, Willie and Indiana rush across the chamber behind 
               the altar. They run over to the ladder and start climbing 
               down into the mines.

               INT. THE MINES

               Willie follows Short Round. Indiana jumps down last and pulls 
               the ladder away, letting it crash to the floor so they won't 
               be followed.

               They draw the attention of the slave children working in the 
               tunnels around the cavern. But it's the sight of the 
               approaching guard that worries Indy --

                                     INDIANA
                         Come on, quick!

               They duck into one of the tunnels. As they hide, Indy watches 
               the guard passing.

                                     WILLIE
                         What're we going to do?

               Indiana looks around at the silent, frightened children who've 
               stopped working in the tunnel and his anger darkens --

                                     INDIANA
                         We're going to get them out of here!

               Then he looks at the bag holding the Sankara Stones and grows 
               still more determined --

                                     INDIANA
                         And then we're going to get these 
                         out of here -- !
                              (seething)
                         And somehow I'm going to see this 
                         place destroyed.

               INT. THE CAVERN - MOMENTS LATER

               A guard passing hears a voice and stops --

                                     INDIANA (O.S.)
                         Ah, sir? Excuse me --

               The guard turns and looks amazed to see Indy smiling at him 
               from the mouth of the tunnel.

                                     INDIANA
                         Listen, I'm from the union and I'd 
                         like to talk about the working 
                         conditions here. Could you step inside 
                         a minute?

               Indy smiles again and disappears into the tunnel. In 
               astonished rage, the guard draws his sword and goes after 
               Indy into the tunnel -- there's a pause and then we hear the 
               guard yell!

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               Willie flattens against the wall as Indiana catapults the 
               big guard past her back into the mine where he's set upon a 
               horde of rebellious slave children.

               The kids swarm over the guard like jackals and we see Short 
               Round pull a key from the struggling guard's robe.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MONTAGE - THE MINES

               A key is twisted and the chains are pulled from kids' legs...

               Elsewhere, more chains are unlocked and rattle free. Liberated 
               kids spill out of the tunnels...

               A guard is tripped and attacked by a horde of ex-slaves...

               In another location, kids wrap captured guards in layers of 
               chains...

               High up on a ledge, a fleeing guard skids to a stop when he 
               sees kids charging at him. He sees more kids rushing from 
               behind him. The guard scrams as he dives off the ledge...

               INT. BEHIND THE ALTAR - DAY

               Freed children scramble up numerous ladders to escape the 
               mines below. They follow the mass of children moving toward 
               the front altar.

               INT. THE ALTAR

               On the altar, under the statue of Kali, Willie and Short 
               Round are helping Indy and some of the bigger children rip 
               down a long wooden panel decorated with hideous Kali figures.

               The children's' escape is blocked by the chasm separating 
               the altar from the deserted worshippers' area of the temple. 
               The swelling crowds of children push and teeter dangerously 
               on the edge of the fire pit.

               Indiana and the others carry the wooden panel through the 
               crowd toward the chasm. They stand it up and when Indy gives 
               the word they drop it --

               The panel crashes across the chasm forming a plank across 
               which the children now begin running to safety.

               INT. BEHIND THE ALTAR

               The last of the children scramble up the ladders and run 
               toward the front of the altar.

               INT. THE ALTAR

               The children's bare feet stomp across the wooden plank -- 
               below them the lava of the fire pit bubbles and shows 
               outbursts of flame.

               Indy stares at the plank and sees that it's starting to smoke 
               from the intense heat rising up.

               On the far side of the plank, the children safely across 
               scatter through the deserted temple toward freedom.

               Willie and Short Round help the last kids out onto the plank -- 
               Indy sees one child's foot break though the smoldering wood -- 
               the kid in front pulls the child to safety.

               Willie and Short Round start to go out onto the plank but 
               Indy shouts at them --

                                     INDIANA
                         No, wait!

               He runs over and pulls them aside -- he steps out onto the 
               plank and takes a few steps to test it -- suddenly the plank 
               bursts into flame in the middle.

               Indy takes one more step -- and then the plank breaks! Indy 
               dives back to the ledge of the altar and Willie and Short 
               Round grab him and pull him up and the wooden plank plummets 
               into the fiery chasm.

                                     WILLIE
                         What're we going to do?!

                                     INDIANA
                         There's got to be another way out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A TUNNEL

               Indiana, Willie and Short Round run through the deserted 
               mine tunnels. They hear a rumbling noise and Indy leads them 
               down a side tunnel. They stop and peer into a quarry.

               INT. THE QUARRY CAVERN

               A large cavern is the depository for the mine cars rolling 
               in with loads of rock. Emaciated children (still unaware of 
               the revolt and the other children's' escape) break their 
               backs shoving the heavily-loaded mine cars.

               Thuggee guards supervise the deadening work, while others 
               operate the pulley-and-hoist system used to drag the cars up 
               the sloped dump ramp.

               Behind this operation, a thunderous waterfall cascades into 
               a huge cistern. From there, chutes deploy the rushing water 
               to power the large conveyor belt below it.

               As the cars rise up the ramp, they tip and spill rocks onto 
               the conveyor belt which carries them toward an awesome stone 
               cylinder that rolls relentlessly, crushing the rocks into 
               sand.

               From the side tunnel, Indiana watches the noisy operation.

                                     INDIANA
                         Those empty cars have got to go out 
                         of the mines.

               Willie and Short Round watch the children push the empty 
               mine cars. The cars gain momentum and roll away down two 
               dark tunnels.

                                     INDIANA
                         Come on, let's see if we can catch a 
                         ride...

               They duck out of the tunnel and run for cover behind a slag 
               heap. Loaded mine cars roaring down from the mines hurtle 
               past them and crash to a stop against the cars in front.

                                     INDIANA
                         Okay, Shorty -- go!

               He pushes Short Round who darts out after a mine car roars 
               past and dodges across the tracks before the next one 
               descends. Indy pushes Willie in the position and holds her 
               ready --

                                     WILLIE
                         I can't!

                                     INDIANA
                         Go!

               After another car crashes past, Indy shoves her. Willie runs 
               out -- her shoe gets stuck and she freezes in the tracks! 
               Willie sees a rock-filled car blasting down out of a tunnel 
               directly toward her!

               Indiana dives, knocking Willie safely to the ground on the 
               other side of the tracks -- the heavy car hurtles past and 
               crashes into the cars in front.

               Indy pulls Willie behind a massive wooden post holding up 
               the dump ramp and they hide from a passing guard.

                                     INDIANA
                         We've got to get across to the empty 
                         cars. Wait here until I signal you.

               They watch him run and hurdle a pile of lumber, bound up 
               three steps and duck behind a tool shack on the platform. 
               Indy reaches out and grabs one of the passing slave children.

               They see Indy put his hand over the kid's mouth and whisper 
               to him. He releases the kid who sneaks away, alerting the 
               other children who start making their escapes into side 
               tunnels.

               Now Indy motions to Short Rounds and Willie to follow. As 
               they start to move out they freeze dead in their tracks and 
               Indy motions again angrily --

                                     INDIANA
                         Come on!

               Willie and Short Round see a guard coming up the steps on 
               the other side of the platform. As the man rises he gets 
               taller and taller -- until they see it's a Thuggee giant 
               coming up behind Indiana.

                                     INDIANA
                         Come one, what's wrong?

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Behind you!

               Indiana turns and looks into the bare chest of the seven-
               foot tall guard. Indy has to look up to see the man's mean-
               looking face.

                                     INDIANA
                         I see the problem...

               Indiana suddenly punches the giant in the stomach -- the 
               giant does not flinch, he just belches rudely.

               Indiana growls and winds up to take a killer swing -- he 
               steps back, cocks his arm -- and suddenly turns and runs 
               away.

               No dummy, Indy dashes over and picks up a piece of wood. The 
               giant starts toward him. Indy drops the wood and looks around 
               for a much larger piece of wood.

               As the giant stalks toward him, Indiana raises the large 
               piece of lumber -- Indy suddenly groans, drops the wood and 
               clutches his stomach. Willie and Short Round looks startled --

                                     WILLIE
                         What happened?

               Short Round shakes his head. They see Indy recover from the 
               spasm as the giant rushes him. Indy jumps aside, landing on 
               a loaded mine car that is passing by.

               The car is being dragged up the dump ramp and the giant jumps 
               out onto it after Indiana. Indy quickly grabs a rock and, as 
               the giant rushes him, Indy smashes the rock against the big 
               man's skull!

               Unfortunately, it's the rock that shatters and not the skull. 
               Indy dives to the other end of the mine car and lifts a large 
               boulder.

               Suddenly Indy drops the boulder and grabs him arm, feeling a 
               shooting pain again. Then he yells as he feels yet another 
               stabbing pain in his left leg.

                                     WILLIE
                         What's wrong with him?

               Shorty is confused and worried -- and then he sees something! 
               He looks up and there on a rock-cut balcony over the cavern 
               is the little Maharajah!

               The little prince clutches the clay kryta doll that represents 
               Indy. He jabs it in the leg with a long sapphire-tipped turban 
               pin.

               On the mine car, Indy yells and grabs his right leg, which 
               collapses beneath him. Short Round takes off. He dashes under 
               the platform toward a bucket-chain carrying spent water back 
               up to the cistern.

               Short Round leaps over the pool of water and grabs onto a 
               bucket. He rises up on this make-shift elevator toward the 
               rock balcony and the malicious little Maharajah.

               Meanwhile, Indy is on the brink of unconsciousness as the 
               giant's massive hands throttle his neck. Indy's head hangs 
               over the end of the mine car and suddenly his eyes widen --

               The car with Indy and the giant reaches the peak of the dump 
               ramp and its upended -- spilling both of them and a shower 
               of rocks down the conveyor belt!

               Down below, Willie dodges wooden pillars and weaves around 
               quarry equipment, trying to follow Indy's battle with the 
               giant. She trips and swears angrily --

               Willie pushes and empty mine car out of her way -- an empty 
               mine car! She runs back and starts shoving the mine car along 
               the rails toward the conveyor belt.

                                     WILLIE
                         I got one! Indy, I got one!

               Near the waterfall, Short Round ascends on the rising bucket 
               chain. Up on the balcony, the little Maharajah chuckles evilly 
               as he watches Indiana on the conveyor belt --

               The Maharajah lifts the clay doll and viciously jabs the pin 
               in the back of it!

               On the conveyor, Indiana gets to his feet and then yells as 
               a stabbing pain lacerates his back! He falls and writhed 
               helplessly as the giant staggers up the rocky conveyor belt 
               toward him.

               Willie shoves the mine car forward. She sees Indy's desperate 
               situation as he's pulled along the conveyor toward the rock 
               crusher!

                                     WILLIE
                         Indy, look out!

               She looks up and sees Short Round leap from the bucket-chain 
               onto the balcony. The little Maharajah's eyes glow fiendishly 
               as he lifts the clay doll -- and jabs the pin into the doll's 
               face.

               On the conveyor belt, Indy yells agonizingly and clutches 
               his stabbed face! Behind him, rocks explode as they're crushed 
               and pulverized by the mammoth roller.

               In front of Indy, the Thuggee giant grabs a pick-axe as the 
               conveyor slides past a tool bin. The giant approaches Indy 
               with it.

               Short Round dashes across the balcony and tackles the 
               Maharajah. They fall and fight like mortal enemies. Short 
               Round sees the little Maharajah's eyes glowing as he punches 
               him in the face.

               Only a few feet away from the rock-smashing roller, Indy is 
               still on his back on the conveyor belt, thrashing in pain, 
               feeling the Maharajah's pin piercing his face. The giant 
               raises the pick-axe above his head and it about to split 
               Indiana in two!

               On the balcony, the Maharajah drops the doll and Short Round 
               dives for it -- he grabs the clay doll and pulls out the 
               pin!

               On the conveyor belt, Indiana is suddenly released from the 
               and looks up to see the giant swinging the pick-axe. Indy 
               rolls aside at the last minute!

               The pick-axe cleaves into the conveyor belt and the giant 
               lurches forward -- Indy gives him a helpful kick, sending 
               the giant flying toward the rock-crusher as Indy jumps off 
               the conveyor belt!

               Seeing the huge roller looming in front of him, the giant 
               crawls desperately against the movement of the conveyor belt -- 
               but he gets snagged!

               The sash around his waist gets caught under the rolling 
               crusher and he's dragged back under it feet first. The Thuggee 
               giant screams hideously as his body is rolled over and 
               squashed by the enormous stone wheel!

               On the balcony, Short Round is jabbing the pin into the 
               squirming little Maharajah. The little prince's eyes still 
               glow yellow as he hollers --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         How you like being pin cushion, Mr. 
                         Rajah-ha-ha?

               The little prince rolls on the ground and tries to fight off 
               Short Round who keeps jabbing him -- suddenly the Maharajah 
               swings and the pin is accidentally rammed clear through his 
               hand!

               Shorty sees the pin sticking through both sides of the kid's 
               hand. The Maharajah stares at his pierced hand, gasping in 
               astonishment.

               Short Round notices the yellow glow dying out of the 
               Maharajah's eyes -- just as Indy's eyes cleared after he was 
               released from Kali's trance.

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         Please -- pull it out!

               Short Round yanks the pin out of the little prince's hand. 
               The Maharajah looks like he's just awakened from a bad dream.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         It was the black sleep of Kali...

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         They made me do evil things... may 
                         lord Krishna forgive me.

               Meanwhile, Indy runs along the catwalk above the conveyor 
               belt. He jumps and grabs onto a cross-board -- he kicks out 
               with his feet and knocks a quarry guard off the catwalk.

               The guard flies through the air and topples into the sand 
               pit where he thrashes around blindly under the sand falling 
               from the crusher.

               Across the cavern, Willie shoves the rolling mine car toward 
               the balcony.

                                     WILLIE
                         Get down here, Shorty! I got us a 
                         ride!

               Willie shrills as another quarry guard rushes toward her. 
               She yanks the iron brake-handle off the mine car and holds 
               it threateningly like a baseball bat --

                                     WILLIE
                         Come on, let's see how hard your 
                         head is!

               Up on the rock balcony, Short Round lowers himself over the 
               edge. The little Maharajah grabs his arm --

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         Please -- listen -- to go out you 
                         must take the left tunnel.

               Shorty looks at him and he knows he's telling the truth.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Thanks pal.

                                     MAHARAJAH
                         I'm going to try to find the English 
                         soldiers.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Good luck.

               Short Round slips over the edge and slides down a wet 
               stalactite to the floor of the cavern.

               There he finds Willie swinging the brake-handle and smashing 
               the guard in the gut. The man doubles in pain -- Willie kicks 
               his butt and he splashes into the pool of water.

                                     WILLIE
                         I don't appreciate being cooked like 
                         a french fry!

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Willie, come on!

               Willie starts pushing the empty mine car with Short Round.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         You do pretty good for a girl!

               Across the quarry, Mola Ram and six temple guards run out 
               onto a high platform next to the waterfall. Mola Ram sees 
               Willie and Short Round pushing the mine car.

               Mola Ram shouts to his men -- two of them pull pistols and 
               open fire!

               Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Short Round shoves 
               Willie to the far side of the car where they both take cover.

               Meanwhile, up on a catwalk, a guard slices a sword through 
               the air and Indiana ducks! The sword slashes into a wooden 
               railing and the guard tries frantically to pull it out --

               Indiana slams his knee up into the guard's stomach and then 
               smashes his fist down on his neck -- the man collapses. Indy 
               hears more gunfire.

               Indiana rushes along the catwalk toward the platform above. 
               He edges against the wall below the platform, staying out of 
               sight as he unfurls his whip.

               One of Mola Ram's guards fires again from the high platform 
               and Indiana lashes the whip -- the whip wraps around the 
               gunman's arm and Indy yanks on it --

               The gunman topples through the air and crashes down onto the 
               catwalk. Indy grabs the gun. He kicks the guard off the 
               catwalk and the man falls into the waterfall pool.

               As the other guards fire down at him, Indiana dodges along 
               the catwalk and fires back at them. A bullet explodes near 
               Mola Ram and he ducks back --

               Meanwhile, Short Round and Willie have the mine car rolling 
               and they jump into it --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy! Hurry!

               Indiana spots the rolling mine car racing across the quarry. 
               Indy takes off and runs along the catwalk -- bullets explode 
               around him, splintering wood. Indy reaches the end of the 
               catwalk --

               Suddenly he dives into the air and catches hold of a block 
               and tackle! Indy skids along the pulley system, sliding down 
               a cable toward the mine car in which Short Round and Willie 
               are riding.

               Bullets whiz past as Indiana sails in the air above the 
               speeding mine car -- when they are in sync, Indy lets go and 
               drops into the mine car next to Willie and Short Round!

               Mola Ram rushes forward and watches the speeding mine car 
               rolling down the track toward the tunnels --

                                     MOLA RAM
                         They've stolen the Sankara Stones -- 
                         they must be stopped!

               In the speeding mine car, Indy sees the tracks separating in 
               two directions -- one back into the quarry, the other toward 
               two tunnels that lead out of the mines.

               Indiana lifts a shovel from the floor of the car and swings 
               it just in time -- he hits a switch which CLANGS as they 
               speed by and the car is shunted tipsy-turvy onto the track 
               toward the two tunnels.

               Willie hangs on as the car tears down the track toward the 
               tunnel on the right -- and Short Round looks worried --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         No, Indy, it's left tunnel.

               But it's too late and they all hold on as the mine car shoots 
               down into the darkness of the echoing tunnel.

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               The wind rushes past Indiana as the car descends into the 
               tunnel and picks up speed. Willie hangs on with Short Round -- 
               the mine car roars around a curve and flies faster along the 
               rails.

               INT. THE QUARRY

               Back in the quarry, Mola Ram supervises the guards as they 
               shove empty cars toward the tunnel. Carrying long Khyber 
               rifles, they jump aboard the cars. The first one rolls into 
               the dark tunnel and the second car speeds after it.

               INT. THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE

               The two Thuggee cars shoot past, descending into the darkness 
               in pursuit of the infidels who stole the Sankara Stones.

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               The mine car hurtles past. Indy sits in front, pulling back 
               on the brake-lever to control their speed and keep them from 
               careening off the tracks.

               Expecting trouble, Short Round peers over the back end of 
               the car. Willie ducks low, watching the heavy beams flashing 
               dangerously close above their heads.

               Then Willie's eyes go wide and she groans in terror like a 
               girl on a roller coaster as the mine car suddenly plunges 
               downward, taking their stomachs with it.

               A gunshot rings out and Short Round sees the first Thuggee 
               car appear around a curve behind them. Mola Ram's gunmen 
               start blasting. Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Indy 
               yells back to Short Round.

                                     INDIANA
                         Come here and take the brake!

               Short Round scurries forward and grabs the brake from Indy.

                                     INDIANA
                         Slow on the curves or we'll fly off 
                         the tracks!

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Read you loud and clear, Indy!

               Short Round grins as he holds the brake -- Willie realizes 
               that this is Shorty's idea of a good time!

               INT. THE CAVERN

               Up in the quarry, gunmen push a third car toward the tunnel, 
               but Mola Ram stops them. He shouts and they turn and look 
               instead toward the waterfall and huge cistern...

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               Indiana is crouched in the back of the zooming mine bar 
               blasting away with the pistol he captured in the quarry.

               A gunman in the car behind returns his fire, the explosions 
               lighting up the tunnel walls.

               Indy aims and fires again -- the gunman is hit and knocked 
               back in the car. Another guard with a Khyber rifle moves up 
               to the front and starts firing.

               Meanwhile, as the car goes into a hard turn, Short Round 
               rides the brake -- beneath the car we see the brake-pad 
               scraping on the metal wheel.

               The tunnel gets lower and Indy has to duck under each beam 
               flying over and can only pop up to fire between the low beams.

               The rifleman in the car behind is reloading. Then he lifts 
               his rifle -- Indy pops up simultaneously and shoots!

               The gunman is hit, his rifle flies up and his head smashes 
               against the beam hurtling above! Screaming horribly, the 
               gunman is knocked from the speeding car like a broken doll.

               INT. THE CAVERN

               Up in the quarry, Mola Ram's men swing sledge hammers, bashing 
               away at the rock supports under the huge water-filled cistern.

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               Indiana runs out of bullets. He sees the car behind getting 
               closer. He tosses the pistol and hits a Thuggee in the head. 
               Another Thuggee retrieves Indy's pistol and starts reloading 
               it.

               Suddenly Indy is being shot at by his own gun and he yells 
               to Short Round:

                                     INDIANA
                         Let up on the brake!

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         What?

               Indy shoves past Willie and takes the brake lever from Shorty.

                                     INDIANA
                         Let her go! Our only chance is 
                         outrunning them!

                                     WILLIE
                         What above the curves?!

               Short Round looks scared as Indy released the brake and the 
               car hurtles toward a curve. They grab the sides of the car 
               as it tips precariously. Behind them, the curve throws the 
               gunmen from side to side in the car following.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy, look out!

               A sharper curve looms ahead and Indy shoves the brake 
               completely off!

                                     WILLIE
                         What're you doing?! We're going too 
                         fast!!

               Willie closes her eyes as they rocket toward the curve. In 
               the car behind, the Thuggee guard at the brake also shoves 
               the brake off -- and looks extremely worried. Indy's car 
               hits the curve and the centrifugal force lifts the inside 
               wheels off the rails!

                                     INDIANA
                         Get over on the other side!

               Willie and Short Round jumps over to his side as the car 
               whips around the curve! Indy looks back and sees the car 
               pursuing them is also taking the curve at full speed --

               Suddenly the Thuggee car swerves dangerously, the weight 
               shifts too much to the outside -- and the car derails!

               The car bounces off the tracks and flies through the air 
               into a siding where is CRASHES against a stone wall in an 
               EXPLOSION of rock and metal!

               Pieces of debris pommel the drive of the second Thuggee car 
               and he quickly grabs for the brake to slow down and avoid 
               the same fate! In the lead car, Indy smiles smugly as Willie 
               opens her eyes.

                                     INDIANA
                         One down, one to go!

               INT. THE CAVERN ABOVE

               Mola Ram's guards continue to bash away with sledge hammers 
               at the rock supports under the mammoth cistern. One of the 
               supports starts to crumble --

               From above, we see the cistern list to one side and water 
               laps dangerously over the edge as the huge tank creaks and 
               sways.

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               Indiana and Short Round heft a railroad tie out of the bottom 
               of the car and Willie watches them lift it onto the back.

               As gunfire continues to explode from the car behind them, 
               Indiana and Short Round shove the railroad tie off the back 
               of the car --

               The wooden railroad tie falls and bounces back across the 
               tracks. The gunmen in the car behind spot it and yell in 
               panic --

               Indy and Willie watch the car behind crash into the railroad 
               tie -- but the tie just skids, catches and bounces up and 
               out of the way like a huge tumbling matchstick!

                                     WILLIE
                         Anymore ideas...?

                                     INDIANA
                         Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!

               INT. THE CAVERN

               The sledgehammers continue -- until two of the rock supports 
               give way! There are shouts as the guards run for cover.

               Mola Ram stands on a platform watching the huge cistern slowly 
               keel over -- the noise is incredible as the colossal tank 
               crashes to the ground!

               Suddenly a half-million gallons of water explode across the 
               cavern and surge in a tidal wave toward the tunnels!

               INT. THE TUNNEL

               The walls of the tunnel flash past and curves appear suddenly 
               out of the darkness as the hair-raising chase continues.

               Short Round and Willie struggle to help Indy lift a large 
               boulder from the bottom of the speeding mine car. The cars 
               descend again into a stretch of much lower tunnel where the 
               beams flash past inches above them. Indy judges the beams --

                                     INDIANA
                         Okay -- one -- two -- NOW!

               All three of them groan as they raise the boulder and shove 
               it off the back of the car -- ducking instantly to avoid 
               being decapitated by the next beam!

               Looking back, they see the gunmen pop up between the beams -- 
               and they see the looks of terror on the gunmen's faces as 
               they see the boulder in front of them!

               The Thuggee car hits the boulder and upends! The guards scream 
               horribly as the car tumbles end over end, slamming against 
               the tunnel walls, getting ripped to shreds so that finally 
               only pieces of metal, wheels and debris fly like a meteorite 
               shower down the tunnel!

               Willie whoops for joy and hugs Indy who smiles modestly --

                                     INDIANA
                         Okay, Shorty, hit the brakes!

               Short Round dives for the front of the car and happily pulls 
               the brake lever -- it doesn't work! Short Round yanks on it 
               harder -- the brake level suddenly breaks off!

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Indy!!

               Indy sees Short Round holding up the broken brake lever! 
               Indy crawls quickly toward Shorty while Willie holds on for 
               dear life! Completely out of control, the car hurtles down a 
               decline into a section where the tunnel if larger again --

               Indiana bends over the front of the car and looks underneath. 
               He sees the brake tension hanging loose from the brake-pad. 
               Indiana pulls himself back up and looks at Willie and Short 
               Round.

                                     INDIANA
                         Grab onto me -- I'm going to try and 
                         slow us down from underneath!

               Willie looks terrified but helps Short Round grab onto Indy's 
               arm and the back of his jacket. He skips over the front of 
               the car and swings a leg underneath --

               Indy is inches above the rails and the rocky ground blurring 
               beneath the car as he tries to kick at the brake-pad. His 
               feet fall and he bumps along, dragged dangerously for a moment --

               Indy manages to find a foothold on the undercarriage of the 
               car. As they hold onto him, Indy kicks again and his foot 
               hits the brake-pad. He shoves it and slowly the pad closes 
               against the spinning wheel...

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh no!

               Willie and Short Round look up and see that the tunnel is 
               ending ahead and the track dead-ends into a stone wall!

                                     INDIANA
                         What's wrong?

               He looks around -- and sees the car rocketing directly toward 
               the stone wall!

               Indy's foot starts kicking in high-gear underneath the car -- 
               he slams at the brake-pad with all his strength -- the pad 
               screeches against the spinning wheel and starts sparking!

               The car seems to slow as it shoots toward the end of the 
               tunnel. Indy groans and pushes hard against the smoking brake-
               pad. The car slows more and more until it runs down the last 
               few yards to the dead-end and rolls gently to a stop, just 
               nudging Indy's back against the wall...

                                     INDIANA
                         Ouch...

               Willie looks faint as Indiana gets to his feet and Shorty 
               jumps out of the car. They help Willie out and she stands 
               shakily --

                                     WILLIE
                         I'm okay -- I'm fine -- I love to 
                         flirt with death...

               Indiana sees that the tunnel ahead continues without any 
               more tracks. Then they hear something --

               A strange rumbling sound echoing down the tunnel from behind 
               them. The walls seem to reverberate. Looking worried, they 
               start walking away down the tunnel. They walk faster as the 
               noise behind them becomes louder and they keep glancing over 
               their shoulders --

                                     WILLIE
                         What's that?... Indy?!

               Indiana isn't sure and he pulls Willie by the arm and all 
               three of them start jogging.

               The rumbling behind them sounds increasingly ominous and 
               finally they start running full tilt. They rush down the 
               tunnel and the awful noise becomes deafening! Willie looks 
               around again and slows suddenly --

               Willie stops dead in her tracks -- paralyzed -- awestruck -- 
               DOOMED! Willie sees a monster wall of water (released from 
               the quarry) as it thunders around a curve -- a mammoth tidal 
               wave crashing spectacularly against the opposite tunnel wall!

               A veritable "tsunami" caroming off the tunnel wall and spewing 
               furiously forward like a hydrous Juggernaut!

                                     WILLIE
                              (frozen in her tracks)
                         Oh... shit...

               Indiana and Short Round notice that Willie's slowed and they 
               stop running -- they also see the cataclysm of water crashing 
               down the tunnel toward them. Indy runs back and grabs Willie. 
               All three of them take off, running faster than they've ever 
               run in their lives!

               The tidal wave smashes forward, booming behind them and 
               Indiana realizes quickly that they're going to lose this 
               race. Suddenly he sees a small side-tunnel in a bend ahead --

                                     INDIANA
                         There! Dive!

               They lunge toward the hole and Short Round dives in it first. 
               Indiana shoves Willie into the hole and jumps in after her 
               just as the colossal tidal wave explodes past!

               INT. THE CHUTE

               The small tunnel drops precipitously and they slide down, 
               showered by the small side-current of water that's broken 
               off from the main force.

               INT. A LARGE TUNNEL

               They rolls and tumble out of the small chute into a larger 
               tunnel. The roar of the tidal wave sounds distant and receding 
               as they catch their breath.

                                     INDIANA
                         Lucky I found a short cut. Look, 
                         there's a light at the end of the 
                         tunnel...

               Suddenly an EXPLOSION! They turn and see the thundering tidal 
               wave crashing around a curve and cascading down the tunnel 
               behind them again!

                                     WILLIE
                         Some short cut!

               They all holler in unison and start running like bats out of 
               hell toward the daylight. The towering wall of water surges 
               relentlessly after them --

               The tidal wave looms up to annihilate them as they race to 
               the mouth of the tunnel -- and Willie SCREAMS! Indy grabs 
               her and all three of the flail their arms to keep from losing 
               their balance!

               EXT. THE TUNNEL EXIT - DAY

               The tunnel exits midway up a cliff and the three totter 
               precariously on the brink looking down at a 300 foot sheer 
               drop to a gorge below! Indiana swings Willie onto a narrow 
               ledge on one side and pushes Short Round after her -- he 
               jumps himself to the other side just as the tidal wave crashes 
               past them!

               The water bursts out of the tunnel -- the gusher spews forth 
               from the cliffside into the air as if Hoover Dam just broke 
               lose!

               Short Round and Willie balance on the narrow ledge on one 
               side of the geyser -- Indy is perches on the ledge on the 
               other side of the incredible eruption of water. Willie gets 
               vertigo looking down into the gorge where the water crashes 
               at the bottom. There crocodiles are disturbed and slither 
               angrily. Indy looks up and sees a rope bridge swinging about 
               twenty feet above Willie and Short Round. Indy shouts across 
               the blasting water --

                                     INDIANA
                         Willie -- the bridge! Climb up to 
                         the bridge!

               Willie looks frightened.

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Nothing to it -- follow me!

               He edges along the narrow ledge toward the bridge and Willie 
               follows him. Once under the bridge, they start climbing up 
               the rocks to it. Meanwhile, Indiana is scaling the cliff 
               face to get over the water geyser to the other side. He grabs 
               at scrub brush and finds a few perilous footholds as he makes 
               his way to the bridge.

               EXT. THE ROPE BRIDGE

               Willie and Short Round pull themselves up at the end of the 
               bridge. Behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines. 
               What's in front of them is hardly more reassuring --

               The rope bridge across the gorge is a century old and 
               definitely wasn't built by army engineers. Laying across the 
               two bottom rope-spans, worm-eaten and moldy boards offer 
               risky footings. Vertical side ropes connect the bottom rope-
               spans to the two upper ropes that constitute the dangerous 
               hand-railings. Short Round steps tentatively out onto the 
               bridge. It holds him and he turns and smiles at Willie --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Easy like pie! Kid's stuff!

               Suddenly the board under him breaks! Willie grabs Short Round 
               before he falls into the abyss! Looking pale and less cocky, 
               Short Round starts out again and Willie follows his carefully.

               They continue stepping across the bridge cautiously, a feat 
               made more difficult by the bridge's constant swaying and the 
               heart-stopping up and down movement.

               Behind them, Indy finally pulls himself up from under the 
               bridge. He stands up and sees Willie and Short Round halfway 
               across already. Then he hears something and turns quickly -- 
               he takes his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as 
               two Thuggee guards rush out.

               Indy cracks the whip, catching the first guard around the 
               neck -- the guard spills forward and trips the second guard. 
               The first man tries to stand but Indiana kicks him in the 
               head.

               The second guard gets to his feet and swings his sword -- 
               Indy ducks, slams him in the stomach and dives for the first 
               guard's sword. He grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the 
               second guard attempts to slice him in two! Indy gets to his 
               feet and immediately finds himself about to engage in a sword 
               duel with the enraged Thuggee guard. Indy looks at the 
               unfamiliar sword, hefts it, and tries to quickly decide the 
               best way to use it -- Suddenly the guard shouts and charges. 
               Indy decides shouting must be the "de rigueur" technique and 
               shouts back loudly -- the two swords CLANG and spark as the 
               duel erupts.

               Indy flails and feints and the Thuggee guard lunges and 
               slashes. Indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches 
               the Thuggee guard who slumps defeated into the dirt.

               Keeping the sword, Indy starts out onto the bridge, walking 
               as quickly as possible across the rickety span. He hears 
               shouting ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear 
               at the far end of the bridge. The guards surprise Willie and 
               Shorty as they finally get across the bridge. Struggling 
               futilely with the guards, Willie shouts at Indiana --

                                     WILLIE
                         Indy -- looks out behind you!

               Indy sees more Thuggee guards rushing out of the tunnel behind 
               him. He turns and sees two of the temple guards who captured 
               Willie and Short Round coming across the bridge in front of 
               him.

               Indy stands helpless in the middle of the swaying bridge 
               with guards approaching from both sides, and nothing but 
               heaven above and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below!

               wind comes up and the High Priest, Mola Ram, appears on the 
               far end of the bridge. He stands with the guards who hold 
               Willie and Short Round. The wind whips around Indy and he 
               staggers unsteadily on the swaying bridge as he watches Mola 
               Ram --

                                     INDIANA
                         Let my friends go!

               Mola Ram shouts in Hindi and the guards start to move toward 
               Indy from both sides of the bridge.

                                     INDIANA
                         That's far enough!

                                     MOLA RAM
                         You are in no position to give orders, 
                         Dr. Jones.

               Indiana indicates the bag over his shoulder --

                                     INDIANA
                         You want the stones, let them go and 
                         call off your guards!

               Mola Ram motions and the guards move farther out on both 
               sides of the bridge -- suddenly Indiana swings the sword and 
               it cuts into one of the bottom rope-spans!

               The rope is half-severed and frays slowly under the tension!

                                     MOLA RAM
                         Impressive, Dr. Jones. But I don't 
                         believe you would kill yourself!

               Mola Ram motions again the his guards (looking more nervous 
               now) step farther out onto the bridge, moving closer to Indy 
               from both sides.

               Indy swings the sword again, cutting into the other rope-
               span! It, too, is now partially severed and frays slowly. 
               The bridge jolts and Indy and the guards sway precariously!

               Suddenly Mola Ram shoves Short Round out onto the bridge. 
               The High Priest draws a dagger and pushes Willie onto the 
               swaying span, holding the knife behind them both.

                                     MOLA RAM
                         Your friends will die with you!

               In different times this would be called a Mexican stand-off 
               Indiana looks at the guards in front and behind him. He sees 
               Willie and Short Round out on the bridge now with Mola Ram 
               at their backs.

                                     INDIANA
                         Then I guess we're all going to take 
                         a big dive!

               Indy and Short Round's eyes meet -- and the kid realizes 
               that his hero isn't kidding. Willie looks at Shout Round 
               anxiously -- she notices that Shorty is surreptitiously 
               wrapping his foot around a rope support. Petrified, Willie 
               also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and does likewise 
               with her arm --

                                     MOLA RAM
                         Give me the stones!

                                     INDIANA
                         Mola Ram -- you're about to meet 
                         Kali -- in Hell!

               Indiana swings the sword with all his might -- it whooshes 
               through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom 
               ropes! Immediately Mola Ram's guards start to flee in panic -- 
               too late! Indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes 
               on the other side are severed --

               The rope bridge is sheared in two! It breaks in the middle 
               and both halves fall apart! The guards scream horribly in 
               the air as they plunge down into the rocky gorge! Willie and 
               Short Round cling to their established footholds and fall 
               with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge. Mola Ram spills 
               forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats --

               Below them, Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with 
               the bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically 
               now, dangling from its moorings at the top.

               There's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain 
               alive realize they are alive. Short Round and Willie cling 
               near the top of the now vertical bridge.

               Below them, Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes 
               while directly above him the last of his guards holds on for 
               dear life.

               Short Round and Willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and 
               stepping on slats. Finally, Short Round heaves himself up 
               onto solid ground and turns to help Willie up.

               Meanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, Indy reaches up and 
               grabs Mola Ram's leg. The High Priest kicks and tries to 
               break Indy's grip. He kicks again and smashes Indy in the 
               face.

               Indy won't let go. Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and 
               grabs his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front 
               of his shirt -- Mola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto 
               Indy, trying to dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming 
               Thuggee. Indy manages to hang on. The Thuggee is less 
               fortunate and falls screaming to his death. Then Mola Ram 
               looks across the gorge and yells. Indy sees a dozen of the 
               last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only to 
               be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge.

               Indy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again. He grabs at 
               the back of Mola Ram's robe and pull him down. Slipping, 
               Mola Ram turns and it's Indy's chance to punch Mola Ram in 
               the face.

               Mola Ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting 
               incoherently. He grabs the strap of Indy's shoulder bag and 
               stamps on Indy's hand -- Indy falls!

               Indiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hold of something -- 
               meanwhile, Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones.

               Indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously 
               near the bottom of the bridge. Across the gorge, the Thuggee 
               guards run up a path to a small gove of trees growing on a 
               plateau above the gorge. The guards have bows and arrows and 
               take firing positions --

               At the top of the bridge, Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks 
               start pounding him from above -- Willie and Short Round pelt 
               him with rocks which he tries to block with his arm.

               Indiana starts to climb again, using all his strength. He 
               reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes 
               into the wood!

               Indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing 
               across the chasm directly for him! Across the gorge, by the 
               grove of trees, a Thuggee priest yells orders to the archers 
               who continue to launch the flaming arrows.

               Indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the 
               continuing bursts of fiery arrows. At the top, Mola Ram 
               reaches up desperately for a hand hold -- Willie smashes his 
               hand with a rock!

               The High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy 
               slugs him again in the face! They struggle as the fire burns 
               up from beneath them.

               On the cliff above the fallen bridge, Willie watches the 
               fire rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight. Short 
               Round turns and sees something --

                                     SHORT ROUND
                         Willie, look!

               They see horses galloping through a narrow pass -- the British 
               cavalry is returning. Captain Blumburtt and the first troops 
               draw up their forces and dismount quickly.

               A fusillade of flaming arrows force the British to take cover -- 
               they quickly start firing back at the Thuggees with rifles.

               As the battle above the gorge continues, Indy and Mola Ram 
               fight below on the dangling bridge -- Indiana sees the High 
               Priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses insanely. Mola 
               Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and Indy yells 
               in pain --

               Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's 
               hand starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's 
               chest during the temple sacrifice)!

               Mola Ram's finger are inching into Indy's body -- Indy 
               clutches at Mola Ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the 
               deadly fingers away from his heart.

               Slowly, Indy is able to push Mola Ram's hand away and his 
               fingers withdraw from Indy's chest. Indiana suddenly slugs 
               the High Priest in the face and grabs for the bag of Sankara 
               Stones --

                                     MOLA RAM
                         No, the stones are mine!

                                     INDIANA
                         You're betrayed Shiva.
                              (he repeats in Sanskrit 
                              Sankara's warning)

               As Indy pronounces the magical words, the bag begins glowing 
               and starts to burn Mola Ram as he clutches it -- the stones 
               begin to spill out of the bag and the High Priest grabs from 
               them.

                                     INDIANA
                              (he repeats Sankara's 
                              warning in Sanskrit)

               The blazing stones sear Mola Ram's flesh and he screams in 
               pain. The light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant 
               he looks at Indy as if awakened from a nightmare -- Mola Ram 
               loses his balance and Indy grabs for the stones. He manages 
               to clutch only one of them as Mola Ram screams and falls!

               Indy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool. He watches 
               Mola Ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally 
               crashing into the jagged rocks at the bottom.

               The irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more -- but soon 
               welcome the meal that just dropped in. Jaws flash and teeth 
               rip at the High Priest's lifeless corpse.

               And Indy's bag with the Sankara Stones sinks into the murkily 
               current and disappears down the river...

               EXT. THE CLIFF

               Indiana crawls up the burning bridge and Willie and Short 
               Round reach for him at the top. They pull him up onto the 
               cliff and they all look around exhausted --

               Across the gorge, more British troops emerge from the mine 
               tunnels to subdue the remaining Thuggee guards on that side.

               Finally the little Maharajah comes out of the dark mine 
               tunnel. He sees Short Round across the gorge -- and bows to 
               thank him for his help. On the other side, Short Round waves 
               his cap, saluting him back. Willie stands at the edge of the 
               gorge looking down into the river far below.

                                     WILLIE
                         I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.

                                     INDIANA
                         Not quite.

               She sees Indy reach into his pocket. He pulls something out 
               slowly -- as she watches he reveals a crystal stone --

                                     INDIANA
                         The last Sankara Stone.

               Short Round watches Willie take it carefully from Indiana. 
               She gazes at it and looks delighted --

                                     WILLIE
                         And the diamond hidden inside...

               Willie holds the stone up to the sun and it sparkles and 
               flashes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY

               The sun flares and silhouettes three figures coming over a 
               hilltop. Behind them we see more smaller silhouettes appearing 
               over the rise.

               Indiana, Willie and Short Round walk back down the dirt road 
               into Mayapore -- followed by a multitude of children returning 
               to their homeland. Willie looks at the changed landscape and 
               seems astonished: the barren countryside has been reborn. 
               They see streams flowing beneath green trees, flowers blooming 
               and peasants harvesting golden grain in the fields.

               EXT. MAYAPORE VILLAGE

               Indiana, Willie and Short Round lead the children down the 
               village road. Ahead they see villagers rebuilding their 
               primitive dwellings.

               Now they hear shouts of joy from the peasants. The children 
               returning home start running to meet their parents who are 
               rushing out to greet them.

               There is laughter and tears as families are reunited. Indiana 
               sees the old shaman approaching with the chieftain and the 
               village elders.

               The shaman touches his fingers to his forehead and bows. The 
               three travelers return his greeting and the shaman is quite 
               moved as he speaks to Indiana --

                                     SHAMAN
                         We know you are coming back --
                              (indicating the 
                              countryside)
                         when life returns to our village.

                                     WILLIE
                         It's a real miracle.

                                     SHAMAN
                         Now you see the magic of the "rock" 
                         you bring back.

               The old shaman smiles wisely at Indiana. Indy takes the stone 
               out of his bag and unwraps it.

                                     INDIANA
                         Yes, I've seen its power.

               Willie watches the shaman take it reverently and bow to them. 
               The shaman joins the elders and they walk to the village's 
               small sacred mound. Indy and Willie stay back. They see him 
               kneel and replace the stone in its niche.

                                     INDIANA
                         The last Sankara Stone.

                                     WILLIE
                         And they don't even know what it 
                         really is.

                                     INDIANA
                              (smiling at her)
                         Well, you didn't get your prince, 
                         and there goes your diamond.

                                     WILLIE
                         You didn't do so well yourself. 
                         Finding that stone could've gotten 
                         you all the fortune and glory you 
                         were talking about.

                                     INDIANA
                         It's still a long way to Delhi. Who 
                         knows what might happen.

               She looks at him like he's crazy.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh no, I'm finding a native guide 
                         who knows the way. No more detours 
                         for me, thank you Dr. Jones.

               She turns and starts walking away continuing to complain --

                                     WILLIE
                         If you think I'm going to Delhi or 
                         anyplace else with you, after all 
                         the trouble you've gotten me into...

               Suddenly the bullwhip CRACKS and wraps around her waist. 
               Startled Willie looks angry as Indiana reels her in, pulling 
               her toward him and into his arms. But when he finally kisses 
               her, she doesn't seem to mind at all... Short Round shakes 
               his head, but looks sort of pleased. When he turns away, his 
               face lights up!

               Short Round runs toward the sunset, toward the three elephants 
               being brought back to the village. The baby elephant starts 
               walking faster, as if he recognizes Short Round running out 
               to meet him...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

       FADE IN:
1      EXT.  PERU - HIGH JUNGLE - DAY                          1
       The dense, lush rain forests of the eastern slopes of
       the Andes, the place known as "The Eyebrow of the Jun-
       gle".  Ragged, jutting canyon walls are half-hidden by
       the thick mists.
       The MAIN TITLE is followed by this:
                                  PERU
                                  1936
       A narrow trail across the green face of the canyon.  A
       group of men make their way along it.  At the head of
       the party is an American, INDIANA JONES.  He wears a
       short leather jacket, a flapped holster, and a brimmed
       felt hat with a weird feather stuck in the band.  Behind
       him come two Spanish Peruvians, SATIPO and BARRANCA.
       Bringing up the rear are five Yagua INDIANS.  They act
       as porters and are wrangling the two heavily-packed
       llamas.  The Indians become increasingly nervous.  They
       speak to each other in bursts of Quechua.  The American,
       who is known to his friends as Indy, glances back at them.
                                   BARRANCA
                                   (irritated)
                     They're talking about the Curse
                     again!
       He turns and yells at the Indians in Quechua, his anger
       giving an indication of his own fears.  The party reaches
       a break in the canyon wall and takes the trail through it.
       When they emerge, their destination is revealed to them
       in the distance.  Beyond a thick stand of trees is the
       vegetation-enshrouded TEMPLE OF THE CHACHAPOYAN WARRIORS,
       2000 years old.
       The entire party is struck by the sight.  The Indians,
       terrified now, chatter away.  Suddenly the three at the
       back turn and run, dropping their packs as they go.  Bar
       ranca yells at the fleeing Indians and pulls his pistol
       out.  He starts to raise his arm to aim but Indy restrains

       it in a muscular grip.
                                   INDY
                     No.
       Barranca looks evilly at Indy's hand upon him.  Indy re-
       leases him and smiles in a friendly way.
                                  INDY
                    We don't need them.
       Satipo watches this confrontation with some concern.
                                  BARRANCA
                    I do not carry supplies.
                                  INDY
                    We'll leave them.  Once we've got
                    it, we'll be able to reach the plane
                    by dusk.
       He turns back to the trail.  Satipo gets the two remaining
       Indians moving behind Indy.  Satipo and Barranca then have
       a fast, silent communication:  Barranca indicates his de-
       sire to slit Indy's throat; Satipo gives him a look that
       says "Be patient, you idiot".
2      THE APPROACH TO THE TEMPLE                              2
       The party fans out to fight their way through the en-
       twined trees that guard the temple.  Visibility is cut to
       five feet in the heavy mist.  Satipo extracts a short,
       native dart from a tree and examines the point gingerly
                                  SATIPO
                             (showing Indy)
                    The Hovitos are near.  The poison
                    is still fresh...three days.  They're
                    following us, I tell you.
                                  INDY
                    If they knew we were here, they would
                    have killed us already.
       The two Indiana jabber in Quechua, near hysteria.  Bar-
       ranca is sweating profusely, eyes darting.  He yells at
       the Indians in Quechua to "shut up".
       In the undergrowth, there is slithering movement.
       Indian #1 draws aside a branch and is faced with a hor-
       rific stone sculpture of a Chachapoyan demon.  The Indian
       is so frightened no sound comes out when he screams.  He
       turns and runs silently away.
       Indian #2 calls to his friend.  Getting no response, he
       steps in that direction.  A huge macaw, flushed from the
       undergrowth, screams and flies away.  Indian #2 does ex-
       actly the same thing, never to be seen again.
       Indy, Satipo and Barranca, just clearing the trees, look
       back in that direction.  They all turn to face the Temple.
       It is dark and awesome.  Vegetation curls from every
       crevice, over each elaborate frieze.  The entrance--
       round, open and black--has been designed to look like
       open jaws.
                                  INDY
                    So this is where Forrestal cashed in.
                                  SATIPO
                    A friend of yours?
                                  INDY
                    Competitor.  He was good, very good.
                                  BARRANCA
                                  (nervous)
                    No one has ever come out of there alive.
                    Why should we put our faith in you?
       Indy takes the weird feather from the band of his hat.
       From around its point, he slips a tightly rolled piece
       of parchment.  Barranca and Satipo exchange a quick "So
       that's where is was!" look.  They all kneel as Indy
       spreads out the parchment.  On it is one-half of a crude
       floorplan of the Temple.
                                  INDY
                    No one ever had what we have...
                    partners.
       Indy fixes them with an expectant stare.  Satipo produces
       a similar, but folded, piece of parchment.  He lays it--
       the other half of the floorplan--next to Indy's.  They
       all regard it for a moment, then Indy stands and walks
       toward the Temple.  Barranca's eyes are shining as they
       dart between the floorplan and Satipo.
                                  INDY
                               (back turned)
                    Assuming that pillar there marks
                    the corner and...
       Barranca is suddenly on his feet, quietly drawing his pis-
       tol.  He raises it toward Indy as Satipo realizes with
       alarm what he's doing.  Too late.  Indy's head turns and
       he sees Barranca.
       Indy's next move is amazing, graceful and fast, yet
       totally unhurried.  His right hand slides up under the back
       of his leather jacket and emerges grasping the handle of
       a neatly curled bullwhip.  With the same fluid move that
       brings Indy's body around to face the Peruvian, the whip
       uncoils to its full ten foot length and flashes out.
       The fall of the whip (the unplaited strip at the end of
       the lash) wraps itself around Barranca's hand and pistol.
       He could not drop the gun now if he tried.
       Indy gives the whip a short pull and Barranca's arm in
       jerked down, where it involuntarily discharges the gun
       into the dirt.  Barranca is amazed, but feels some slack
       in the whip and immediately raises the gun toward Indy
       again, cocking it with his free hand.
       Indy's face goes hard.  And sad.
       Indy sweeps his arm in a wide arc.  Barranca spins around,
       enclosed in the whip, his gun hand stuck tight against
       his body.  Indy gives one more short jerk on the whip
       handle and Barranca's gun fires.  Barranca falls dead.
       Indy looks quickly at Satipo, who is shocked and fright-
       ened.  He raises his arms in supplication.
                                  SATIPO
                    I knew nothing!  He was crazy!
                    Please!
       Indy looks him over, then nods.  He frees the whip from
       Barranca's body and picks up the man.  His eyes sweep
       the surrounding woods.
                                   INDY
                    Let's go.
3      INT. TEMPLE - INCLINED PASSAGE - DAY                    3
       Indy and Satipo, carrying a torch, walk up the slightly
       inclined, tubular passage from the main entrance.  The
       interior is wet and dark, hanging with plant life and
       stalactites.  Their echoing footsteps intermittently
       overpower the sounds of loud dripping, whistling air
       drafts and scampering claws.
4      HALL OF SHADOWS                                         4
       Indy leads the way down a twisting hallway, Satipo's
       torch barely lighting his way from behind.  Indy dis-
       appears in a shadow and when he reappears a moment later
       a huge black tarantula is crawling up the back of his
       jacket.  Indy doesn't notice and disappears into another
       shadow, emerging with two more tarantulas on his back.
       Satipo sees them and makes a frightened grunting sound.
       Indy looks at him, sees what he's pointing at and cas-
       ually brushes all three spiders off with his rolled
       whip, as he would a fly.  Satipo pirouettes for an in-
       spection and Indy flicks one off the Peruvian's back.
       Indy begins picking up little pocket-sized artifacts from
       the niches and ledges of the Temple.  He continues to
       do this as the men penetrate the Temple.  His collecting
       is quick and expert, evaluating the pieces in an instant,
       discarding some, stuffing others into his clothes, and
       never stopping his forward progress.
5      CHAMBER OF LIGHT                                        5
       The men reach an arch in the hall.  The small chamber
       ahead, which interrupts the hall, is brightly lit by a
       shaft of sunlight from high above.  Indy stops, looks
       it over.
                                  SATIPO
                    What's wrong?  Are you lost?
       Indy picks up a stick and throws it through the shaft
       of light.  Giant spikes spring together from the sides
       of the chamber with a ferocious CLANG!  And impaled on
       the spikes are the remains of a white man, half-fleshed,
       half skeleton, in explorer-type grab.  Indy reaches out
       and takes hold of the man's carcass.  As the spikes slowly
       retract, Indy pulls it free and seats the remains gently
       on the floor.
                                  INDY
                    Forrestal.
                                  SATIPO
                                  (gulps)
                    We can go no further.
                                  INDY
                    Now, Satipo, we don't want to be
                    discouraged by every little thing.
       Indy steps sideways into the chamber.  His back pressed
       against the very points of the retracted spikes, he moves
       along the edge of the light beam, and steps clear on the
       other side.  Satipo grimaces and begins sweating his way
       through.
6      STAIRWAY                                                6
       Indy and Satipo come down stone stairs to a tight land-
       ing.  Framing the entry are a carefully strung network of
       dead vines, each somehow hooked into the wall, narrowing
       the opening even more.
                                   INDY
                           (taking torch)
                    Let me see that.
       He lowers the torch to the floor of the landing.  The
       landing is carpeted with human skeletons, one on top of
       another, all squashed flat as cardboard.  Satipo gasps.
       Indy looks up at the ceiling of the landing, then steps
       onto skeletons, which make a cracking noise under his feet.
                                  INDY
                    Try not to touch the vines.

7      FOYER OF THE SANTUARY                                   7
       The men are in a high, straight hallway 50 feet long.
       The door at the end is flooded with sunlight.
                                  SATIPO
                    Senor, I think we are very close.
       Indy stands still looking at the hall.
                                  SATIPO
                                (impatient)
                    Let us hurry.  There is nothing
                    to fear here.
                                  INDY
                    That's what scares me.
       They begin walking down the hall side by side.  Satipo
       has inched a little ahead.  Suddenly his lead foot comes
       down and through the floor!  As Satipo begins to pitch
       forward, Indy grabs him by the belt and pulls him back.
       They both look down at the "floor".
       Indy swings his whip across the floor.  Fifteen feet of
       it cuts open beneath the lash, falling away to reveal
       black pit as wide as the hall.  The illusory floor was
       made of dust-covered cobwebs.  Satipo picks up a stone
       and drops it down the pit.  No sound.  The two men ex-
       change glances.  Indy looks up at the high roof of the
       hall.  He swings the whip up around a support beam, tests
       its strength with a pull and swings over the pit on the
       whip.  From the other side he swings the whip back to
       Satipo, who throws Indy the torch.  Satipo swings across.
       When they are both standing on solid floor there is a
       moment of quiet in which they hear, from far, far below--
       SPLASH!  Indy wedges the whip handle into the wall and
       leaves it strung to the beam for quick retreat.
8      THE SANTUARY                                            8
       A large, domed room.  Ten evenly-spaced skylights send
       their shafts of sunlight down to a unique tiled floor:
       white and black tiles laid out in a lovely, intricate
       pattern.  Indy and Satipo stand at the door and look
       across the wide room at the altar.  There, in the supreme
       hallowed spot, is a tiny jeweled figurine, Indy's real
       objective.
       Two torches, many years old, are in holders by the door.
       Indy takes one down and lights it.  He gives the regular
       torch to Satipo.
                                   SATIPO
                     There's plenty of light, amigo.
       Indy kneels and uses the unlit end of the torch to reach
       out and tap a white tile.  It is solid.  He taps a black
       tile.  There is a whizzing sound and a tiny dark sticks
       in the torch.  Satipo points to the wall nearby: there is
       a recessed hole there.
                                   SATIPO
                     From that hole!
       Indy nods, stands and looks around the sanctuary.  The
       entire room is honey-comed with the same kind of hole.
       Satipo sees it too and is properly impressed.
                                   INDY
                     You wait here.
                                   SATIPO
                     If you insist, senor.
       Torch in hand, Indy begins his careful walk across the
       sanctuary.  Stepping only on the white tiles, he almost
       appears to be doing a martial arts kata.  Before each
       big move he waves the torch in front of him head to toe,
       looking at the flame.  Halfway out, he sees something
       on the floor and kneels to look at it.
       A dead bird lies on one of the white tiles.  Its body is
       riddled with little deadly darts.  This has great signi-
       ficance to Indy and he stands with even greater caution.
       He waves the torch ahead of him and at waist height an
       air current whips at the flame.  Indy ducks under it and
       leaves a burn mark on the white tile beneath it.
       Satipo watches, wide-eyed and mystified.
       Indy reaches the altar.  The tiny idol looks both fierce
       and beautiful.  It rests on a pedestal of polished stone.
       Indy looks the whole set-up over very carefully.  From
       his jacket he takes a small, canvas drawstring bad.  He
       begins filling it with dirt from around the case of the
       altar.  When he has created a weight that he thinks ap-
       proximates the weight of the idol, he bounces it a couple
       times in his palm concentrating.  It's clear he wants to
       replace the idol with the bag as smoothly as possible.
       His hand seems ready to do that once, when he stops, takes
       a breath and loosens his shoulder muscles.  Now he sets
       himself again.  And makes the switch!  The idol is now in
       his hand, the bag on the pedestal.  For a long moment it
       sits there, then the polished stone beneath the bag drops
       five inches. This sets off an AURAL CHAIN REACTION of
       steadily increasing volume as some huge mysterious mechanism
       rumbles into action deep in the temple.
       Indy spins and starts his kata back across the sanctuary
       at four times the speed.
       Satipo's eyes widen in terror.  He turns and runs.
9      THE RETREAT - INTERCUTTING INDY AND SATIPO              9
       The sanctuary has begun to rumble and shake in response
       to the mysterious mechanism.  Just as Indy goes out the
       door, a rock shakes loose from the wall and rolls onto the
       tiles floor.  Immediately, a noisy torrent of poison darts
       filles the room.
       IN THE FOYER, Satipo swings across the pit.  He makes it
       just as the whip comes undone from the beam, leaving Indy
       without an escape.  Satipo, extremely nervous, regards
       the whip a moment then turns back to face Indy, who has
       run up to the far side of the pit.
                                   SATIPO
                     No time to argue.  Throw me the
                     idol, I throw you the whip.
       Indy hesitates, eyeing the rumbling walls.
                                   SATIPO
                     You have no choice!  Hurry!
       Indy concurs with that assessment.  He tosses the idol
       across the pit to Satipo.  Satipo stuffs it in the front
       pocket of his jacket, gives Indy a look, then drops the
       whip on the floor and runs.
                                   SATIPO
                     Adios, amigo!
       Indy grimaces.  He had a feeling this might happen.  He
       looks around.
       AT THE VINED LANDING, Satipo flies through like a chubby
       ballet dancer and takes the steps five at a time.
       IN THE FOYER, Indy runs in full stride to the edge of the
       pit and broad jumps into space.  He doesn't make it.  His
       body hits the far side of the pit and he begins to slide
       out of view.  Only wild clawing with his fingers at the
       edge of the pit stops his descent.  With just the tips
       of his fingers over the edge, he begins pulling himself up.
       AT THE CHAMBER OF LIGHT, Satipo has slowed down.  He begins
       to edge carefully around the light shaft.
       AT THE VINED LANDING, Indy sails through sideways and rolls
       to a stop at the bottom of the steps.  His whip is grasped
       in his hand.  As he raises himself, he hears, from above
       the giant spikes of the Chamber of Light CLANG! and an
       abrupt, sickening rendition of SATIPO'S LAST SCREAM.  Indy
       runs up the steps.  The rumbling sound grows louder.
       AT THE CHAMBER OF LIGHT, Indy slides to a stop.  The
       spikes have retracted, taking Satipo's body to one side.
       Indy edges into the chamber with his back to the shaft
       of light.  Soon he is face to face with the dead Satipo;
       spikes protrude from several vital spots in the Peruvian's
       body.  Indy removes the idol from Satipo's pocket and
       moves quickly out the other side.
                                   INDY
                     Adios.
10     THE INCLINED PASSAGE                                    10
       Indy shoots out of a cut-off hallway and turns toward the
       exit.  The rumbling is very loud and now we see why:
       right behind Indy a huge boulder comes roaring around a
       corner of the passage, perfectly form-fitted to the passage-
       way.  It obliterates everything before it, sending the sta-
       lactites shooting ahead like missles.  Indy dashes for
       the light of the exit.  His hat flies off his head.  Almost
       immediately it is crushed by the boulder.  Indy dives out
       the end of the passage as the boulder slams to a perfect
       fit at the entrance, sealing the Temple.
11     EXT.  FRONT OF THE TEMPLE - DAY                         11
       Indy lies on the ground, gasping for air.  A shadow falls
       across him and he looks up.
       WHAT HE SEES.  looming above him are three figures.  Two
       are HOVITOS WARRIORS in full battle paint and loin cloths.
       They carry long blow guns.  But the man in the center draws
       Indy's attention.  He is a tall, impressive white man,
       dressed in full safari outfit including pith helmet.  His
       name is EMILE BELLOQ.  His face is thin, powerful; his eyes
       hypnotic; his smile charming, yet lethal.  His heavily
       French-accented speech is deep, mellifluous, wonderful.
       Back beyond Belloq and his two escorts, thirty more Hovitos
       Warriors hover at the edge of the trees.
                                   BELLOQ
                     Dr. Jones, you choose the wrong
                     friends.  This time it will cost you.
       Belloq extends his hand.  Indy looks at it, then pro-
       duces the idol and hands it to Belloq.  Belloq extends
       his other hand, smiling.  Indy hands over his gun.  Belloq
       sticks it in his jacket.
                                   BELLOQ
                     And you thought I'd given up.
                                   INDY
                            (eyeing the Hovitos)
                     Too bad they don't know you like
                     I do, Belloq.
                                   BELLOQ
                                   (smiles)
                     Yes, too bad.  You could warn
                     them...if only you spoke Hovitos.
       With that, Belloq turns dramatically and holds the idol
       high for all the Hovitos to see and says something in
       Hovitos.  There is a murmur of recognition and all the
       Indians, including Belloq's escorts, prostrate themselves
       upon the ground, heads down.
       Indy is immediately up and running toward the edge of the
       clearing.
                                   BELLOQ
                                (in Hovitos)
                     Kill him!
       AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING, Indy disappears into the
       foliage.  An instant later, the leaves are peppered with
       a rain of poison darts and spears.
12     EXT. THE JUNGLE - INDY'S RUN - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY      12
       Indy runs like hell through steadily falling terrain.
       And always close behind, a swift gang of angry Hovitos.
       Occasionally they get close enough to send a dart or
       spear whizzing past Indy's head.
13     EXT. THE URUBAMBA RIVER - DUSK                          13
       An amphibian plane sits in the water beneath a green cliff.
       Sitting on the wing is JOCK, the British pilot.  Indy
       breaks out of some distant brush and runs along the path
       at the top of the cliff.
                                   INDY
                               (yelling)
                     Get it going!  Get it going!
       Jock hops in and fires up the plane's engines.  Indy
       reaches a spot on the cliff above the place, glances
       back, them jumps into the river.  He comes up, swims
       to the plane and grabs a strut.
                                   INDY
                     GO!
       Jock starts the plane moving across the water as Indy
       walks across the wing and falls into the passenger com-
       partment.

16     INT. JOCK'S PLANE - DUSK                                16
       Indy relaxes and lies across the seat, a big smile on
       his face.  One hand drops to the floor of the cabin and
       Indy jumps, hitting his head.  On the floor of the cabin
       is a huge boa constrictor.  Indy tries to get his whole
       body onto the seat.  Jock sees what's happening.
                                   JOCK
                     Don't mind his.  That's Reggie.
                     Wouldn't hurt a soul.
                                   INDY
                     I can't stand snakes.
                                   JOCK
                     The world's full of them, you know.
                                   INDY
                     I hate them.
                                   JOCK
                     Come on now, Sport, show a little
                     of the old backbone.
17     EXT. JOCK'S PLANE - TWILIGHT                            17
       It soars off over the dark jungle.
18     INT. INDY'S OFFICE, SMALL EASTERN COLLEGE - DAY         18
       It's authum and the pretty, New England campus out Indy's
       window reflects it in dazzling color.  A few weeks be-
       fore the start of classes.  Activity just picking up.
       Some students about.
       Indy is at a bookcase near the window and he looks
       quite different in this setting.  His outfit is tweedy,
       slightly rumpled in the professional style.  Part of his
       attention is focused in a book and he wears glasses to
       see the fine print.  The office is cramped, absolutely
       innundated with books, maps, etchings and archeological
       artifacts.  In fact, the only neat spot in the room right
       now is Indy's desk, which has been cleared off expressly
       for the benefit of--
       MARCUS BRODY, the Curator of the National Museum in Wash-
       ington, D.C.  Brody is examining the small artifacts Indy
       pocketed on his way into the Peruvian Temple.  He occasion-
       ally uses a jeweller's eyepiece to get a closer look.  But
       he is distracted, his concerns elsewhere, and it is this
       that his old friend Indy senses from across the room.
                                   BRODY
                     Do you think the idol will ever
                     show up?
                                   INDY
                     I don't know.  Just because Belloq
                     had it doesn't mean he kept it.
       Indy snaps the book closed and puts it on the shelf.
       He takes his glasses off and focuses on Brody.  At the
       windowed door to his office, two pretty Coeds pause for
       a moment, look in at their sexy Archeology professor,
       giggle and disappear.
                                   INDY
                     Getting it away from those Indians
                     would be a neat trick
                              (a hard look)
                     I hope they got him.
       A young male graduate student, Indy's TEACHING ASSISTANT,
       taps on the door and then pushes his way in with an arm-
       load of reference books.  Indy helps him find a spot
       for them.
                                   TEACHING ASSISTANT
                     I couldn't get the McNabe, Professor.
                     Someone's got it checked out 'til
                     next month when classes start.
                                   INDY
                     That's all right, Phil.  Thanks
                     a lot.
                                   TEACHING ASSISTANT
                                    (eager to please)
                     Will there be anything else?
                                   INDY
                     No.  I'll see you Thursday.
       The Teaching Assistant leaves.  Brody is scowling as
       he examines the last of the artifacts.
                                   INDY
                     Hey, if you don't like them, I can
                     always return them.
                                   BRODY
                     No, they're beautiful.  The Museum
                     will but them as usual.  No ques-
                     tions asked.
                                   INDY
                     Then what's wrong?
                                   BRODY
                     I brought along some people today.
                                   INDY
                     What kind of people?
                                   BRODY
                     Government.
                                   INDY
                              (concerned)
                     Government?
                                   BRODY
                     Don't worry, it's not about your
                     business.
                          (indicates the artifacts)
                     They're from the Army.
                                   INDY
                     I've already served.
                                   BRODY
                     Army Intelligence.  They're looking
                     for Abner.
19     INT.  INDY'S LECTURE HALL/CLASSROOM - DAY               19
       Indy's course--a combination of archeology and anthro-
       pology--is taught in this amphitheater-type lecture hall.
       His desk and lectern hold large reference books; black-
       boards line the wall.  Bones, maps, charts festoon the
       walls.
       Indy leans against his desk talking with Brody and two
       uniformed Army officers, COLONEL MUSGROVE and MAJOR
       EATON, who are situated around the first seats in the
       classroom.
                                   MUSGROVE
                     --But you did study under Professor
                     Ravenwood at the University of Chicago?
                                   INDY
                                   (nods)
                     We haven't spoken in ten years.
                     I'm afraid we had a bit of a fall-
                     ing out.
                                   EATON
                     You know nothing of his whereabouts?
                                   INDY
                                (negative)
                     Just rumors.  Somewhere in Asia, last
                     I heard.
       Musgrove and Eaton exchange a look; they're disappointed.
                                   EATON
                              (to Musgrove)
                     Maybe Dr. Jones can make sense of it.
       Again the military men have a silent communication, de-
       ciding what to reveal.
                                   MUSGROVE
                     Well...you must understand, Dr. Jones,
                     this is all strickly confidential.
                                   INDY
                     I understand.
                                   MUSGROVE
                     Yesterday, one of our European sec-
                     tions intercepted a Nazi communique
                     from Cairo to Berlin.  We don't
                     quite know what to make of it.
       Musgrove takes a sheet from his briefcase.
                                   MUSGROVE
                     Here it is--"Tanis development pro-
                     ceeding.  Acquire headpiece, Staff
                     of Ra, General Tengtu Hok, Shanghai.
                     Locate Abner Ravenwood, U.S."
       Brody is excited.  He looks at Indy.
                                   BRODY
                     Tanis.  They must have discovered
                     the lost ruins.
       Indy contemplates this big news; he's impressed.
                                   INDY
                              (to himself)
                     Tanis.  Ain't that somethin'!
                                   EATON
                     Frankly, we're a little suspicious...
                     An American being mentioned so prom-
                     inently in a secret Nazi cable.
                                   INDY
                     Ah, Ravenwood's no Nazi.
                                   EATON
                     Then what do they want him for?
                                   INDY
                     They're looking for the headpiece
                     to the Staff of Ra.
                                   MUSGROVE
                             (indicates his sheet)
                     But it says here that's in China.
                                   INDY
                     Only half of it.  Ravenwood had
                     the other half.
                                   EATON
                     What would the Nazis want with
                     this--this Staff of Ra?
                                   BRODY
                     I can tell you that.  Over the last
                     two years the Nazis have had teams
                     of archeologists running around the
                     world looking for all kinds of re-
                     ligious artifacts.
                                   MUSGROVE
                     That's right.  Hitler's a nut on
                     the subject.  Crazy.  He's obsessed
                     with the occult.
                                   EATON
                     What is this Staff of Ra, anyway?
                                   INDY
                     It all has to do with the Ark of
                     the Covenant.
                     (the Army guys look mystified)
                     The chest the Hebrews used to carry
                     around the Ten Commandments.
       Now it's the Army men who are impressed.
                                   INDY
                     An Egyptian pharoah stole the Ark
                     from Jerusalem and took it back to
                     the city of Tanis.  A short time
                     later, Tanis was consumed by the
                     desert in a sandstorm that lasted
                     a year.  But before that, the Phar-
                     oah had had the Ark hidden away in
                     a secret chamber called the Well of
                     the Souls.  Which is where the Staff
                     of Ra comes in.
       Indy moves to the blackboard and makes a quick sketch
       to give a rough idea of the system as he describes it.
       (And we get a glimpse of what an interesting and enthu-
       siastic teacher he must be)
                                   INDY
                     Now this was rather clever.  The
                     Staff was really just a big stick--
                     oh, I don't know, say like this--
                      (he indicates about six feet)
                     --no one really knows for sure.  Any-
                     way, it was capped by an elaborate
                     headpiece with a carving of the sun
                     at the top.  What you had to do was
                     take the Staff to a special map room
                     in Tanis--it had the whole city laid
                     out in miniature on the floor.  When
                     you placed the Staff in a certain
                     spot in this room, at a certain time
                     of day, the sun would shine through
                     a hole here in the headpiece and then
                     send a beam of light down here--to
                     the map--giving you the location of
                     the Well of the Souls...
                                   MUSGROVE
                     ...where the Ark of the Covenant
                     was kept.
                                   INDY
                                 (nods)
                     Which is probably what the Nazis
                     are after.
                                   EATON
                     What's this Ark look like?
                                   INDY
                     Look like?  Why, it's right here...
       Indy pulls a big format book from the stack on his lectern
       and flips through the pages until he finds a large color
       print.  The other men gather to look.
       THE PRINT fills the screen.
       It shows a Biblical battle.  The Israelite Army is van-
       quishing an opposition force.  At the forefront of the
       Israelite ranks, two men carry the Ark of the Covenant,
       a beautiful gold chest, crowned by two sculptured gold
       angels.  The men do not touch the Ark itself; rather
       they carry it by use of two long wooden poles which pass
       through rings in the corners of the Ark.  The painting
       is very dramatic, full of smoke, tumult and sinewy dying
       men.  But the most astounding thing in the picture is the
       brilliant jet of white light and flame issuing from the
       wings of the angels.  It pierces deep into the ranks of
       the retreating enemy, wreaking devastation and terror.
                                   EATON
                     Good God!
                                   INDY
                     Yes.  That's what the Hebrews thought.
                                   MUSGROVE
                     What's that supposed to be coming
                     out of there?
                                   INDY
                     Who knows...lightning...fire...the
                     power of God.
                                   EATON
                     I'm beginning to understand Hitler's
                     interest in this thing.
                                   INDY
                     Oh yes.  The Bible tells of it level-
                     ing mountains and wasting entire re-
                     gions.  Moses promised that when the
                     Ark was with you, "your enemies will
                     be scattered and your foes fell be-
                     fore you".
                                 (pause)
                     An army which carries the Ark before
                     it is invincible.
       Eaton and Musgrove exchange worried looks.
                                   INDY
                     Oh, there's one other thing that
                     Hitler undoubtably believes about
                     the Ark...
                         (a long pregnant pause)
                     It's said that the Lost Ark will be
                     recovered at the time of the coming
                     of the True Messiah.
                                   MUSGROVE
                     Dr. Jones, you've been very helpful.
                     I hope we can call on you again if
                     we have questions.
                                   INDY
                     Most certainly.
       Brody and Indy exchange a look as they all shake and
       Brody starts to leave with the Army men.
20     EXT.  FRONT DOOR, INDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                  20
       INdy's English Tudor, upper middle class hoem.  Quite
       toney; well beyond the financial reach of an honest
       college professor.  Marcus Brody has already rung the
       bell.  Indy opens the door.  He is dressed in a tuxedo.
                                   BRODY
                     I've got to talk to you.
                                   INDY
                     This isn't really a good time.
                                   BRODY
                     Indy, it's important.
                                   INDY
                     All right.  Come on in.
21     INT. FOYER, INDY'S HOUSE                                21
       The lush tone continues here in Art Deco and shiny marble.
       Indy motions Brody toward the study to one side.
                                   INDY
                     I'll be in in a minute.
       As Brody passes the entrance to the expansive living room,
       he spots a beautiful, silk-gowned Harlow-type lounging on

22     INT. STUDY, INDY'S HOUSE                                22
       Brody enters the book-lined, dark-wooded study.  He paces
       for a moment before the fire which is dying in the fire-
       place, then spots something and goes over to Indy's big
       desk.  The surface is covered with open books, monographs,
       maps and drawings--all about the Ark of the Covenant.
       Brody smiles; he knows his friend very well.  Indy comes
       in, closing the door behind him.  Brody turns to him with
       a triumphant expression.
                                   BRODY
                     They want you to go for it.  And
                     they'll pay.
                                   INDY
                                  (smiles)
                     Good work, Marcus.  I had a feeling
                     this would happen.  And, of course,
                     the Museum gets the Ark when we're
                     done.
                                   BRODY
                                  (smiles)
                     Of course.
       Indy's manner is vigorous, agressive.
                                   INDY
                     Okay, here's the way it's gonna be.
                     First, I'll high-tail it to Shanghai
                     and get the piece from General Hok.
                     Then I think I know where I can find
                     Ravenwood.  If only I can get--
                                   BRODY
                     General Hok's a tough customer.  They
                     don't call him the Wild Boar for nothing.
                     And he's tied in with the Japanese.
                                   INDY
                     I'll worry about that when the time
                     comes.  My only hope is to find the
                     Well of the Souls before the Nazis do.

24     INT. KEHOE'S CAR (SHANGHAI AIRPORT) - DAY               24
       Indy is barely into the front seat of a dilapidated
       Ford as the driver, BUZZ KEHOE, is peeling out into
       traffic.  In the back seat is a Chinese named BANG
       CHOW.  Kehoe zigs crazily through traffic with only
       his left hand as he reaches over to shake with Indy.
                                   KEHOE
                     Buzz Kehoe, Army Intelligence.
                     You've met Bang Chow.
                                   INDY
                     What's the hurry?
                                   KEHOE
                     Some German agents got here two
                     hours ago.  Luckily, Bang was able
                     to have them detained at Customs.
                     We'll have to hurry.

       Kehoe's car emerges from an alley.  Down the block is
       Tengtu Hok's modest, walled palace.  Kehoe's car slows
       a bit and Bang steps from the moving car with a small
       black suitcase in his hand.  While he heads down the
       street toward Hok's place, Kehoe's car continues across
       the street and into an alley on the other side.
30     EXT.  HOK'S STREET - IN FRONT OF PALACE - DAY           30
       A Mercedes limousine appears round a corner and squeals
       to a stop at the front gate of the palace, which is manned
       by a sturdy Chinese Gateman.  There are three Germans in-
       side, one the driver.
31     EXT.  ALLEY BEHIND HOK'S MUSEUM - DAY                   31
       Kehoe, alone now, pushes a trash container casually into
       position to hide a newly created hole in the rear wall of
       Hok's Museum where several stone blocks have been removed.
       He looks around and ambles back to the car.
32     INT.  HOK'S PALACE - ENTRY HALL                         32
       The three Germans wait impatiently in a magnificent foyer.
       A chime sounds and huge double doors open to reveal TENGTU
       HOK, flanked by two uniformed Japanese Soldiers and a
       roved Chinese Advisor.  He wears a fantastic gold orna-
       mental robe.  Despite the majesty, however, nothing can
       disguise the fact that Hok is basically a wild, fat bar-
       barian; an animal.  Hok and his escort group bow in what
       is the beginning of a long welcoming ceremony.  The Germans
       exchange impatient glances but decide they should play it
       as it comes.  They bow.
33     INT. HOK'S MUSEUM                                       33
       No person in sight.  Instead, we see a magnificent dis-
       play of ancient artifacts.  Glass cases hold the velvet-
       couched pieces at random spots on the shining marble
       floor.  We hear an odd sound.  Near the floor on the rear
       wall of the museum, a steel ventilation grate moves.  A
       hand slides it gently across the marble.  Indy sticks his
       head out and looks around.
34     INT.  HOK'S PALACE - TEA ROOM                           34
       The three Germans are being served tea and exotic deli-
       cacies.  A pleased Tengtu Hok watches from a throne-cushion.
       When the tray of tiny delicacies is presented to him, he
       takes a massive handful, crushing them together on their
       way to his smiling mouth.
35     INT.  HOK'S MUSEUM                                      35
       A huge golden gong, seven feet in diameter, is suspended
       from the ceiling by a hook.  An enormous hammer hangs
       poised above it, from which emanate myraid tiny threads

       which run up and across the ceiling, then down to the
       various display cases.  Indy looks up at the gong, then
       continues his quick, quiet foray among the cases.  Be-
       yond him, a high window.
36     INT.  HOK'S PALACE - TEA ROOM                           36
       Hok and his visitors stand to go.  The German's pleased
       expressions make it clear they're finally on their way
       to the museum.
37     INT.  HOK'S MUSEUM                                      37
       Indy arrives at his destination.  The lovely, carved gold
       section of the headpiece is nested on purple velvet in a
       glass case.  At the bottom of the piece is a round hollow
       where the staff would fit.  There is a grunting sound be-
       hind Indy and he spins, already reaching for his revolver.
       A fierce Japanese Samurai is running at Indy full speed
       down an aisle of display cases.  His sword is raised over
       his shoulder ready to cut Indy in half.  He's six feet a-
       way when Indy's gun levels and fires twice, blasting him
       backwards.  Indy is still looking over his gun when an-
       other samurai sword comes down from the side and knocks
       the pistol brutally out of Indy's grip; his hand avoids
       amputation by a quarter of an inch.
       An amazed Indy backs away from the crossing aisle as the
       Second Samurai steps in to face him, sword raised.  Indy
       backs away into an open space and his bullwhip appears
       in his hand.  He gives it one savage CRACK! to announce
       its arrival and the Samurai slows down, eyeing it curiously.
       The Samurai does not look unhappy about this confrontation.
       How pure it is--The Sword versus The Whip.
38     EXT.  HOK'S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY         38
       Tengtu Hok and the Germans have obviously heard something.
       They are hurrying along the walkway at the side of the
       building, Hok in the lead.  Up ahead is the foot bridge
       which crosses from the palace to the museum entrance over
       a moat.
39     EXT.  STREET IN FRONT OF THE PALACE - DAY               39
       The Lovely Mercedes limousine blows up.
40     EXT.  HOK'S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY         40
       The Germans spin toward the blast.  Drawing weapons, they
       run back to investigate.  Hok follows them, confused.
41     INT.  HOK'S MUSEUM                                      41
       Indy and the Samurai face each other.  They're both breath-
       ing hard from previous, no-contact passes at each other.
       Now Indy begins swinging the whip over his head again.  It
       whizzes out toward the Samurai's face.  The Samurai takes
       two lightning-quick cuts at the leather, but misses.  Indy
       swings for the Samurai's feet; the Japanese jumps nimbly,
       slashing at the whip.  Indy does it again.  The Samurai
       hops it.  Once more.  The Samurai is concentrating on hop-
       ping it.
       Indy sees it.  The split second he wants.  The whip flashes
       up from the floor and wraps solidly and irrevocably around
       the Samurai's neck.  Indy gives it a murderous pull and
       the Samurai is dead on his feet.
42     EXT.  HOK'S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY         42
       Hok and the three Germans are looking d-wn at the flaming
       remains of the Mercedes.  A look of concern crosses Hok's
       face.  He turns and runs back toward his beloved museum.
43     INT.  HOK'S MUSEUM                                      43
       Indy is at the case containing the headpiece.  He smashes
       the glass with a samurai sword, reaches in and grabs the
       piece.  Immediately, behind him, the huge hammer falls
       and the sound of the gong thunders through the museum.
44     EXT.  HOK'S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY - DAY         44
       At the sound of the gong, the running Hok skids to a halt
       with a crazed expression on his face.  He disappears for
       two seconds in an alcove and emerges holding a big, black
       Thompson Submachine Gun.  He runs across the foot bridge
       and is just barely over it when it blows up.  Hok, safe,
       looks behind him in amazement and then turns to the museum.
45     INT.  HOK'S MUSEUM                                      45
       The double doors at the entrance slam open to reveal Hok.
       Indy is halfway along an unprotected wall back to his ven-
       tilation entry route.  Hok opens up on him, cutting off
       his retreat.  Indy jumps behind a marble column, which is
       promptly blasted with machine gun fire.
       Indy looks above him, sees the giant disk of the gong.
       Reaching up, pushing with tremendous effort, he maneuvers
       it off the hook.  It bounces down to the floor on its side,
       chipping the marble with its monstrous weight.  Indy stead-
       ies it and then puts his whole body into rolling it across
       the room toward the window.  As it starts to roll, Indy
       slips behind it and runs across the room with it.
       Hok can see the rolling gong.  He opens up on it.
       The vicious cacophony of machine gun fire is joined by
       the musical reports of bullets hitting the gong and ri-
       cocheting away.  Very, very noisy.
       Behind the gong, Indy gauges his move.  As the gong is
       about to be stopped by a marble bench, Indy talks a long
       stride onto the bench and dives through the glass of the
       high window.  Hok's bullets hit the wall.
46     EXT.  ROOF - DAY                                        46
       Indy lands in a shower of glass on the jutting roof of
       the museum's first floor.  He rolls to a crouch and is
       immediately being fired upon.  The Germans, cut off from
       the museum, are standing on the palace walkway firing at
       him.  Indy takes off fast for the rear of the museum.
47     EXT.  ALLEY BEHIND MUSEUM - DAY                         47
       Kehoe, craning to locate Indy, has the Ford rolling slowly
       along the back of the museum.  Bang scouts from the back
       seat.  Indy appears on the roof at a run, gauges the move-
       ment of the car and jumps from the roof of the museum to
       the roof of the sedan.  Unfortunately, the roof of the
       old car can't take it and Indy's legs knife right on
       through to the interior, where he scares the hell out of
       Kehoe.
48     INT.  KEHOE'S CAR - DAY                                 48
       Indy squirms his way down into the front seat.
                                   KEHOE
                     Jesus!  Are you all right!

                            (he's felt better)
                     Great.  Got it.
       Kehoe guns it, throwing Indy back against the cushions.
                                   KEHOE
                     What now?

       Under a meager seat light, Indy is pouring over a jour-
       nal article by Abner Ravenwood and related map of Nepal.
       A few rows back, across the aisle, a trenchcoated Euro-
       pean Spy eyes Indy.

52.    INT.  "THE RAVEN" SALOON - PATAN, NEPAL - NIGHT         52
       A huge stuffed raven, wings spread wide, is mounted be-
       hind the long bar in the noisy, crowded saloon.  A lively
       mix of patrons is represented in the late hour tableau:
       Nepalese natives, fierce Sherpa mountain guides, sleazy
       international smugglers and fugitives, and, of course,
       mountain climbers from every corner of the earth.  A tall
       Nepalese, MAHDLO, is the bartender.
       In a corner near the fireplace trouble breaks out
       suddenly between the groups at two neighboring tables.
       Ferocious representatives from each table--one a wild-
       looking SHERPA, the other a muscular Australian CLIMBER--
       jump up to face each other.  As the two contenders stand
       poised for action, their respective supporters shift in
       their places, fondling lethal ice axes and clubs.
                                   SHERPA
                     Gmoiska!  Shurga rintoik!
                                   CLIMBER
                     Aye!  That'll be your last word.
       The bar has quieted ominously and so we hear with startling
       clarity when--a door behind the bar slams open with a huge
       BANG! and some Presence, too small to be seen as it moves
       through the forest of towering patrons, makes a beeline
       for the troubled corner of the bar.  A path clears for it.
       The Sherpa and the Climber are about to kill each other
       when the Presence arrives directly between them:  she is
       MARION RAVENWOOD, twenty-five years old, beautiful, if a
       bit hard-looking.  At this moment, however, that look
       does not hurt.  She is not intimidated by the combatants;
       she jabs accusatory fingers into their chests.  She is
       angry as hell.  The patrons shrink under her gaze.
                                   MARION
                     That does it!  I've been patient
                     with you no-goods long enough.  I'm
                     not open at 2 o'clock for myself,
                     you know.  It's all for you.  And
                     how do you repay me:  Trouble and
                     noise and blood on my floor!  I
                     won't have it.  Everybody out! Out!
                     Out!  We're closed.  Closed!  Do your
                     killing outside!  And don't leave any
                     bodies on the porch!
       The place clears quickly.  Stragglers and grumblers are
       given special attention by Marion and Mahdlo, who has
       come from behind the bar carrying a big axe handle.
       Mahdlo herds the crows out the front door as Marion turns
       and walks behind the bar.
       A scowl on her lovely face, she has just begun clearing
       the bar of glasses when she notices one remaining Patron
       huddled over a glass at the far end of the bar.  Grimacing
       in exasperation, she heads that way like a locomotive.
                                   MARION
                     Hey you, deaf one!  I said out of
                     my place.  I don't mean next Easter,
                     I mean now--
       She is almost on him when Indy looks up smiling.  Marion
       stops, stares, shocked.
                                   INDY
                     Hello, Marion.
       She hits him with a solid right to the jaw, knocking him
       off the barstool on the floor.  He rubs his jaw and
       smiles up at her.
                                   INDY
                     Nice to see you, too.
                                   MARION
                     Get up and get out.

                     Take it easy.  I'm looking for
                     your father.
                                   MARION
                                (bitterly)
                     Well you're two years too late.
       Indy's attitude changes instantly.  This is sad news.  He
       is silent for a long time.  Mahdlo comes in the front door
       and hurries forward when he sees Indy with Marion.  He
       looks to her for guidance, but she stays him with a gesture.
                                   MARION
                     Go home, Mahdlo.  I'll see you to-
                     morrow.
       Mahdlo is hesitant, but lays the axe handle on the bar and
       goes out.  Indy has been barely aware of him.  Now he set-
       tles again on the barstool.  Marion has a vindictive look.
       She'll let him stay, but she wants to inflict as much pain
       as possible.
                                   INDY
                     What happened?
                                   MARION
                     Avalanche.  Up there.  He was dig-
                     ging.  What else?  He spent his
                     whole life digging.  Dragging me all
                     over this rotten earth.  For what?
                                   INDY
                     Do you find him?
                                   MARION
                     Hell no.  He's buried where he was
                     working.  Probably preserved real
                     good, too.  In the snow.
       Suddenly the hardness cracks.  She is on the verge of
       tears and does not want him to see them.  She turns away
       and takes a whiskey bottle from the shelf, then turns
       back to pout herself a drink.
                                   INDY
                     Not a bad way to go.  Doing what
                     he loved.
                                   MARION
                                (vitriolic)
                     Don't give me taht stuff!  What
                     do you know?
                            (she takes a drinks)
                     I'm the one that was left in a bad
                     way.  He didn't have a penny.  Guess
                     how I lived, Mister Jones.  I worked
                     here.  And I wasn't the bartender.
                             (another swallow)
                     Finally the guy that owned the joint
                     went crazy.  Snow crazy.  They took
                     his away screaming.  As they dragged
                     him out, he said the place was all
                     mine for life.
       She looks around the saloon.
                                   MARION
                     Can you imagine a more evil curse?
                                  (pause)
                     So far, it's working.
                                   INDY
                     Why not leave?  Go back to the States.
                                   MARION
                     I'll go back.  I'll get there.  Not
                     that there's a soul there who knows
                     my name of cares.  But I'll go.  And
                     when I do, they'll know me.  'Cause
                     I'm going to go back in style.  With
                     money.  A soddamn lady!
                                   INDY
                     Where you gonna get it?
                                   MARION
                     If I knew that, you think I'd still
                     be running this dive?
       Indy looks at her, thinking.  Under his gaze, she blushes,
       for reasons only she understands.  She looks into her
       glass and, for a moment, she softens.
                                   MARION
                     I'll tell you something Indy.  I've
                     learned to hate you in the last ten
                     years.  But somehow, no matter how
                     much I hated you, I always knew that
                     someday you'd come through that door.
                     I never doubted that.  Something made
                     is inevitable.
                                 (hopefully)
                     Why are you here...now...tonight?
       Indy takes a long time to answer.
                                   INDY
                     I need one of the pieces your father
                     collected.
       Marion's eyes go icy.  She swings at him again with her
       right, but this time he catches her at the wrist.  Then
       he stops her left, which she has brought up to slap him.
                                   MARION
                     You son-of-a-bitch!  You know what
                     you did to me, to my life?  This
                     is your handiwork.
                                   INDY
                     I never meant to hurt you.
                                   MARION

                     I was a child!
                                   INDY
                     You knew what you were doing.
                                   MARION
                     I was in love.
                                   INDY
                     I guess that depends on your
                     definition.
                                   MARION
                     It was wrong.  You knew it.
       Indy releases her arms.
                                   INDY
                     Look, I did what I did.  I don't
                     expect you to be happy about it.
                     But maybe we can do each other
                     some good.
                                   MARION
                     Why start now?
                                   INDY
                     Shut up and listen for a second.  I
                     want that piece your father had.
                     I've got money.
       This stops her.
                                   MARION
                     How much?
                                   INDY
                     Enough to get you back to the States.
                     Where are his things?
                                   MARION
                     Gone.  I sold it all.  It was all
                     junk.  The junk he wasted his life on.
                                   INDY
                     Everything?
       Marion nods.
                                   INDY
                               (giving up)
                     That's too bad.
       Indy feels tired, defeated.  Marion is pleased.
                                   MARION
                     You look disappointed.  I like
                     that.  How's it feel?
       Indy has to smile at her glee.
                                   MARION
                         (nods at his empty glass)
                     What are you drinking?
                                   INDY
                     Seltzer.
                                   MARION
                         (refilling his glass)
                     Real man's drink.  Me, I like scotch.
                     And I like bourbon.  And vodka and
                     gin.  I'm not much for brandy.  I'm
                     off that.
       She pours herself another as Indy watches, amused.
                                   INDY
                     You're a tough broad now, aren't you?
                                   MARION
                     It's no act, pal.  This ain't Sche-
                     nectady.
                                   INDY
                     I can only say I'm sorry so many
                     times.
       Marion looks at him thoughtfully, takes a drink.
                                   MARION
                     You really have money?  You don't
                     look rich.
                               (Indy nods)
                     I may be able to locate some of his
                     things.  I know who's got them.
                     What do you want?
                                   INDY
                     A bronze piece, about this size.  In
                     the shape of the sun.  Probably
                     broken off at the bottom.  Has a
                     little hole in it, off-center.
                     Does that sound familiar?
       Marion thinks, nods slowly.
                                   INDY
                     Do you know where it is?
                                   MARION
                     Maybe.  How much?
                                   INDY
                     Three thousand.  American.
                                   MARION
                                 (negative)
                     That'll get me back, but not in
                     style.  This doodad must be pretty
                     importnat.
                                   INDY
                     Maybe.
       A huge smile lights up Marion's face.
                                   MARION
                     I knew it would happen eventually.
                     I knew it.  Something had to go my way.
                         (pours herself another drink)
                     I've got to think this out.  I'm
                     used to bargaining with yaks.
                                   INDY
                     Okay, five thousand.  That's all I
                     can give you now.  I can get you more
                     when you land in the States.
                                   MARION
                     You word, huh?
                              (Indy nods)
                     Just like you said you'd be back last
                     time?  That was your word too.
                                   INDY

                     I'm back, aren't I?
       Marion sneers and they smile together.
                                   INDY
                     You can trust me.
                                   MARION
                     Come back tomorrow.
                                   INDY
                     Why?
                                   MARION
                     Because I said so, that's why.  It's
                     about time I called the shots in this
                     relationship.
       Indy nods, gets up to go.
                                   MARION
                     Wait a minute.  Leave the five thou-
                     sand here.
                             (Indy hesitates)
                     You want trust, give some.  I want to
                     smell your money.
       Indy thinks about this a moment, then reaches inside his
       shirt and pulls cash from a money belt.  He lays five grand
       on the bar.
                                   INDY
                     I trust you.
                                   MARION
                     You're an idiot.
                                   INDY
                     I've heard that.
       Indy starts fro the door. Marion takes another think.
       She is getting high.
                                   MARION
                     Hold it.  Come here.
                                   INDY
                               (moving back)
                     Bossy, aren't you?
                                   MARION
                     That's right.  Give me a kiss.
       Indy looks into her eyes, then leans over the bar and
       kisses her deeply.  When the kiss ends, their faces are
       very close.  Marion is flushed.  She liked it and would
       like more.  She raises her glass between them to disci-
       pline herself.
                                   MARION
                     Get out of my place.
       Indy smiles and walks to the front door.  Then, without
       looking back--
                                   INDY
                     Tomorrow.
       He's gone.  Marion stares after him, thinking.  She takes
       a drink.  Then slowly, her hand comes up to loose the
       scarf that is draped around her throat.  It falls away,
       revealing her graceful neck above the dipping top of her
       blouse.  Hanging there on a gold chain against her white
       skin is a sun-shaped golden medallion.  The bottom looks
       broken off.  Marion lifts the medallion so she can see it
       in her hand, then looks thoughtfully after Indy.
53     EXT.  STREETS OUTSIDE "THE RAVEN" - NIGHT               53
       Indy sits thinking at the wheel of an old car.  Finally,
       he puts the car in gear and drives away.
       Across the street, the shadow in a doorway comes to life.
       A dark form steps out to look at Indy's departing car;
       it is the European Spy from the DC-3.  He hurries off
       in the opposite direction.
                                                        DISSOLVE TO:
54     INT.  "THE RAVEN" - NIGHT                               54
       Marion stands before the fire that is shrinking in the
       fireplace.  She jabs at it abstractedly with a poker,
       thinking.  Suddenly tears well up in her eyes.  She lets
       the poker slip from her hand, wipes away the tears.  She
       walks across the room to the end of the bar, still clut-
       tered with bottles and glasses, and stops at the pile of
       American money Indy has left.  She takes the chain from
       around her neck and lets the medallion slide off it into
       her hand.  She places it on the bar next to the pile of
       money, thinking.  Then, having reached some decision, she
       picks up the pile of bills, walks up the back of the bar
       and pulls a small wooden box from under the bar.  She flips
       open the top, puts the cash inside and closes the top.
       She leaves the box on the bar and starts back toward
       the medallion.  The front door of the saloon bursts
       open and Four Bad Men come in.  Marion, halfway between
       the valuable possessions and not wishing to draw
       attention to either, stops where she is.
       The Four Bad Men who advance on her are:
       1.) the obvious leader, a short, vile, sadistic German
       in spectacles by the name of BELZIG.
       2.) a trenchcoated SECOND NAZI.
       3.) a ratty-looking NEPALESE and
       4.) a mean MONGOLIAN.  The second NAZI and the MONGOLIAN
           both carry submachine guns.
                                   BELZIG
                     Good evening, Fraulein.
                                   MARION
                     The bar's closed.
                                   BELZIG
                     We are not thirsty.
       The Mongolian and the Nepalese poke around, checking
       to make sure there's no one else there.
       Down at the end of the bar, the medallion lies partially
       hidden by surrounding glasses and bottles.  The Second
       Nazi stops very near it, but turns his back to it to face
       Belzig and Marion.
                                   MARION
                     What do you want?
                                   BELZIG
                     The name thing your friend Dr. Jones
                     wanted.  Surely he told you there would
                     be other interested parties.
       Marion shakes her head.
                                   BELZIG
                     Ah, the man is nefarious.  I hope
                     for your sake he has not yet acquired
                     it.
                                   MARION
                     Why, are you willing to offer more?
                                   BELZIG
                     Almost certainly.  Do you still have it?
                                   MARION
                     No.  But I know where it is.
       Belzig's smile fades at this news.  He's not a patient sort.
       Marion is chilled by the look.  She turns and moves to the
       shelf of bottles behind her, reaching high for one, very
       near the large stuffed raven.  He hand lingers there a
       moment and we see--
       From an angle behind the stuffed raven, that the left wing
       spread hides a Baretta automatic pistol.  Marion's hand is
       very near it, but withdraws with only a whiskey bottle as
       the Mongolian walks toward her behind the bar.
       Marion opens the bottle before Belzig, who watches her
       intently.
                                   MARION
                     How 'bout a drink for you and your
                     men?
       The Second Nazi lights up at this suggestion.  Belzig gives
       him a withering look.
                                   BELZIG
                     We will stick to the business at hand,
                     Fraulein.
                                   MARION
                                  (tough)
                     Fine.  Why don't you come back to-
                     morrow when Jones is here and we'll
                     have an auction?
       Belzig gives her a cold look then turns and walks over to-
       ward the firplace.  As soon as his back is turned, the
       Second Nazi grabs the nearest whiskey bottle and takes a
       quick pull.  In so doing, he leaves the medallion completely
       exposed.  Marion is aware of this as she looks at him.  But
       he quickly puts the bottle down again, obscuring the medal-
       lion, when Belzig speaks from the fireplace.
                                   BELZIG
                     I'm afraid an auction is not possible.
                                  (pause)
                     Your fire is dying here, Fraulein.
                        (a beat, then threatening)
                     Why don't you tell us where the
                     piece is right now?
                                   MARION
                     Listen, Herr Mac, I don't know who
                     you're used to dealing with, but
                     no one tells me what to do in my
                     place.
       Belzig, still looking in the fire, sneers and shakes
       his head.
                                   BELZIG
                     Americans!  You're all alike.  Frau-
                     lein Ravenwood.  I'll show you want
                     I'm used to.
       He motions with his hand.  The Mongolian moves up behind
       Marion and lifts her roughly over the top of the bar,
       knocking over bottles and spilling liquor.  He deposits
       her on the other side, where the Nepalese and the Second
       Nazi flank her and hold her cruelly, arms behind her back.
       Marion raises a ruckus.
       Belzig turns from the fireplace.  In his hand is the poker,
       its end glowing orange.  He advances on Marion.  Marion
       stops yelling, her eyes widen in terror.
                                   MARION
                     Wait!  I can be reasonable--
                                   BELZIG
                     That time is passed.
       The glowing poker point moves inexorably across the room
       toward Marion's face.
                                   MARION
                     You don't need that.  I'll tell you
                     everything!
                                   BELZIG
                     Yes, I know you will.
       Belzig has no intention of stopping now.  The glowing tip
       is approaching Marion's face.  The Nepalese watches with
       savage glee.
       The tip of the poker is five inches from Marion's nose
       when there is a loud CRACK! and the fall of Indy's bull-
       whip wraps around the middle of the poker and tears it
       out of Belzig's hands.  The poker sails high across the
       room, free of the whip, and lands in the heavy curtains
       that cover one window.  The curtains immediately burst
       into flame.
       The four Bad Men look in surprise toward the front en-
       trance.  Indy is poised there, the whip in his right
       hand, a .45 automatic raised toward them in his left.
                                   INDY
                     Hello.
       Now everything begins to happen very fast--
       The Mongolian had just come around the bar at the end
       opposite the medallion.  He dives back to crouch behind
       the end of the bar, raising his submachine gun.
       Belzig and the Second German dive behind tables near the
       bar.  The Nepalese is slower to leave Marion, he draws a
       Luger.  Indy's .45 barks and the Nepalese dies spinning
       against the bar.  Indy fires in the direction of the
       Mongolian.
       Marion swings up over the top of her bar.  Belzig fires at
       her, but his bullets smash bottles behind the bar and thud
       into the raven.
       Marion flattens out on the floor behind the bar as bullets
       hit above her.  She reaches up, snatches the axe handle
       from where Mahdlo left it, and begins crawling down the
       length of the bar toward--
       The Mongolian, who sticks his submachine gun out and fires
       blindly in Indy's direction.
       Indy is in a crouch behind a table, trying to get a shot
       at someone.  He doesn't notice in the din and confusion
       when the door bursts open.  An incredible, fearsome GIANT
       SHERPA, almost seven feet tall, soars in and tackles Indy
       from behind.  The whip flies from Indy's hand as he and
       the Giant Sherpa roll across the floor, upsetting furniture.
       The Mongolian, seeing this, stands up confidently.  Marion
       rises behind him and bashes him over the head with the axe
       handle.  He goes down and out.
       Fire has completely engulfed the curtains and is working
       across the ceiling on decorative yak skin bunting.  A burn-
       ing fragment drops to the top of the bar, which immediately
       lights up, fueled by the spilled alcohol.  Full whiskey
       bottles explode like Molotov cocktails.
       Rolling on the floor, Indy and the Giant Sherpa are fight-
       ing for control of Indy's .45.  Belzig sees this and shouts
       to the Second Nazi, who is rising from cover with submachine
       gun in hand.

                                   BELZIG
                     Shoot them both!
                                   SECOND NAZI
                     He's our man!
                                   BELZIG
                     Do as I say!

       Both the Giant Sherpa and Indy hear this.  The Giant
       Sherpa exchanges an alarmed look with Indy and together
       they swing the .45 around toward the surprised Second
       Nazi.  Two blasts blow him away.
       That done, Indy brings a brass spittoon down on the Giant
       Sherpa's wrist and the .45 slides away.  Indy jumps up and
       kicks the Giant Sherpa, who barely seems to feel it.  He
       grabs Indy and flips him effortlessly onto a table.
       Belzig now has a clear shot at Indy.  He raises his luger.
       Marion, at the end of the bar, finally gets the hand of
       the Mongolian's submachine gun.  It roars to life in the
       general direction of the ceiling.
       Belzig runs for cover as Marion gets control of the gun
       and levels it.  Belzig dives around the end of the bar
       opposite Marion.  When he has set himself, he peeks up over
       the edge of the scorched bar.  The alcohol fire has moved
       down the bar and now, much to Belzig's surprise, he finds
       himself staring at the fire-blackened sun-shaped medallion!
       His eyes widen.  He cannot believe his good fortune.  With-
       out hesitation he picks up the metal medallion, palming it.
       Immediately there is a sickening searing sound and Belzig's
       expression changes from joy to agony.  He screams in pain
       and tries to shake the red-hot medallion from his skin.
       Marion opens up and the bar starts to splinter in front of
       Belzig.  The medallion comes free of Belzig's hand and
       rolls across the floor.
       Belzig has had enough.  In excruciating pain, he turns,
       sees a window, runs and dives through the glass.

       An exhausted Indy uses his whole body to upend the Giant
       Sherpa, who lands hard on his back.  They are surrounded
       by flames.
55     EXT.  "THE RAVEN" - SNOW BANK - NIGHT                   55
       Belzig has his burned hand stuck deep in the snow.  Now
       he withdraws it, steaming, and scurries off into the night
       like a wounded animal.
56     INT.  "THE RAVEN" - NIGHT                               56
       Marion throws down the empty submachine gun and moves
       through the flames to the center of the bar where she left
       the box with the five grand.  She finds the remains of the
       box and its contents:  a shapeless pile of ash and charred
       wood.
                                   MARION
                     Unbelievable!
       At the end of the bar, the Mongolian has come back to life.
       He shakes out his head, then reaches inside his coat and
       pulls out a Mauser pistol.
       Indy smashes a chair over the head of the Giant Sherpa and
       the huge creature goes down.
       The Mongolian points his Mauser through the smoke and flame
       at Indy.  Suddenly, the Mongolian is shot dead.
       Marion stands beneath her stuffed raven with the Baretta.
       Indy moves quickly through the flames, his eyes scanning
       the floor.  He picks up his bullwhip and his crumpled felt
       hat.  He peers through the smoke till he spots Marion mov-
       ing among the burning furniture.
                                   INDY
                     Let's get out of here!
                                   MARION
                     Not without that piece you want!
                                   INDY

                     It's here?
       Marion nods, kicks aside a burning chair.  Another burning
       beam falls from the roof.  Indy pulls Marion close to him
       protectively.
                                   INDY
                     Forget it!  I want you out of here.
                     Now!
       He begins dragging her out.
                                   MARION
                                (pointing)
                     There!
       She breaks away from him, darts back and picks the hot
       medallion up in the loose cloth of her blouse.
                                   INDY
                     Let's go!
                                   MARION
                               (looking around)
                     You burned down my place!
                                   INDY
                               (figuratively)
                     I owe you plenty!
                                   MARION
                               (literally)
                     You owe me plenty!
                                   INDY
                               (smiles)
                     You're something!
                                   MARION
                     I am something.  And I'll tell you
                     exactly what--
       She holds up the medallion possessively.
                                   MARION
                     I'm your partner!
57     EXT.  CAIRO - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                       57
       First we see the sprawl, the soaring minarets, the an-
       cient skyline.  Then we're closer, in the narrow, exotic
       streets, teeming with life:  fierce-looking men in tattered
       galabiyas, black-gowned women with veiled faces, ragged,
       barefoot children.

59     INT.  DINING ROOM - SALLAH'S HOUSE (OLD CAIRO)          59
       Indy and Marion have been welcomed like family into the
       crowded home of SALLAH, his wife FAYAH, and their NINE
       CHILDREN (ages 4 - 18).  Fayah, a huge, imposing woman,
       appears, at first glance, to be the power in the house.
       Sallah, a small, cheerful, energetic fellow in his for-
       ties defers to his wife in all matters of little importance.
       Suddenly the general liveliness at the children's table
       escalates into pandemonium, attracting the attention of
       the adults.
                                   FAYAH
                     Silence!
                           (there is silence)
                     Why do you forget yourselves?
       The gaggle of grinning off-spring parts to reveal in their
       midst--a MONKEY.  It is munching some flat Arab bread.
                                   FAYAH
                     What is this?  Who brought this
                     animal in?
       All the children chatter their innocence at once.  The
       Monkey chatters too; it's an entertainer.  The Monkey
       jumps from the children's table to the adults' and struts
       slowly up toward Marion, who thinks it's the cutest thing
       she ever saw.  When it reaches her, it takes off its tur-
       ban and does a deep, grand bow to her.  She is deligthed
       and takes the Monkey into her arms.  The Monkey kisses
       her cheek.  The children laugh.
                                   MARION
                     Why, thank you.  I like you too.
                                   FAYAH
                     Then it shall be welcome in our house.
                                   MARION
                     Oh, no!  You don't have to have it
                     around if you don't want it--
                                   SALLAH
                               (cheerfully)
                     All of Allah's creatures are welcome
                     here.  You please us by letting us
                     please you.

61     EXT.  COURTYARD - SALLAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT                61
       Indy and Sallah sit in the small, protected courtyard.
       Sallah holds the two sections of the headpiece, the medal-
       lion and the base, and has for the first time fitted them
       together.  They fit perfectly and complete the headpiece.
       He peruses the markings on the headpiece quizzically.  Indy
       is cleaning and loading a .45 automatic.

                     I knew the Germans would hire you,
                     Sallah.  They couldn't have an ex-
                     cavation in the desert without the
                     best digger in Egypt.
                                   SALLAH
                     All Arabs look alike to them, Indy.
                                   INDY
                     Tell me about the map room at Tanis.
                                   SALLAH
                     We found it three days ago.  I
                     broke through myself.
                                   INDY
                     Those Nazis are moving awfully fast.
                                   SALLAH
                     The Frenchman is helping them.
       Indy reacts.
                                   INDY
                     Belloq.  So he got away from the
                     Indians.  This is going to be
                     more interesting that I thought.
                                   SALLAH
                     I'm afraid this has put the Germans
                     close to finding the Well of the Souls.
                                   INDY
                          (indicates the headpiece)
                     Even Belloq won't be able to find it
                     without that.  Can you make anything
                     of those markings?  They're nothing
                     I'm familiar with.
                                   SALLAH
                          (shakes his head "no")
                     But I know someone who might.  You
                     can go to see him tomorrow.
                          (a worried expression)
                     Indy...something bothers me.
                                   INDY
                     What is it, my friend?
       Sallah finds it hard to say.  When he finally speaks, his
       words are accompanied by a strange, eerie, foreboding rush
       of wind through the courtyard.  Just a coincidence we might
       suppose.
                                   SALLAH
                     It is the Ark.  If it is there, at
                     Tanis...It is not something man was
                     meant to disturb...Death has always
                     surrounded it.  It is not of this
                     earth.
       The wind dies down.  Indy shakes off a chill and stares
       thoughtfully at his friend.
62     EXT.  HEAVILY TRAFFICKED CAIRO STREET - DAY            62
       Indy and Marion are briskly walking along one of Cairo's
       busy bazaar streets. Vendors with fine cloth, pottery,
       baskets, jewelry, etc line the street.  Marion has the
       Monkey from Sallah's house on her shoulder.
                                   INDY
                     Do you really need that monkey?
                                   MARION
                     I'm surprised at you, Indy. Talk-
                     ing that way about our baby.  He's
                     got your looks, too.
                                   INDY
                     And your brains.
       As Indy and Marion turn a corner, the Monkey seems to
       notice something and immediately jumps from Marion's
       shoulder and hurries off at a frantic pace down the street.
                                   MARION
                         (looking disappointed)
                     Hey!  Hey!... where're you going?
                                   INDY
                             (dragging Marion on)
                     He'll be OK.  Come on.  Come on.
63     EXT.  ANOTHER CAIRO STREET - DAY                        63
       The Monkey is seen running around another corner and
       jumps into the waiting arms of MONKEY MAN, who appears
       to be like a beggar with a dirty turban and an eye patch.
       MONKEY MAN immediately hurries down the street and passes
       into a building. In the building are two GERMAN AGENTS.
       MONKEY MAN and the MONKEY both give the Heil Hitler salute
       and engage in quick talk.
       MONKEY MAN quickly leaves the two GERMAN AGENTS and gets
       back to the street. He is obviously shadowing Indy and
       Marion. Indy and Marion are just now passing by the MONKEY
       MAN ducks back behind some baskets.
64     EXT.  ANOTHER BUSY CAIRO STREET - DAY                   64
       Indy and Marion are passing under a balcony where a lone
       GERMAN AGENT stands watch. After they pass, the AGENT nods
       to some BAD ARABS who are hiding in the shadows of the
       street.  In a moment, Indy and Marion pass by the break.
       Monkey Man turns and looks up at a roof further down the
       alley.  He waves with his hand.  Someone up there waves
       back.
65     EXT.  A SMALL BAZAAR - DAY                              65
       Indy and Marion have reached a tiny square, made even
       more cramped by its use as a small bazaar.  They have
       started working their way through the crowd when several
       Bad Arabs and a German Agent begin to converge on them.
       Indy immediately sees what's happening and pulls the bull
       whip from his jacket.  The first Bad Arab to reach them
       gets hit in the mouth by the handle of the whip.  Now all
       hell breaks loose, with Bad Arabs, Innocent Shoppers, bas-
       kets of fruit and tables of goods flying every which way
       in the constricted space.
                                   INDY
                               (to Marion)
                     Run!  Get out of here!
       Indy catches a dagger-wielding Bad Arab around the legs
       with the whip and flips him.  Marion is reluctant to leave
       Indy.
                                   INDY
                     Go, dammit!  Go!
       Marion goes.  She runs off between two buildings.  A Bad
       Arab takes off after her.  Monkey Man, now standing at
       the edge of the square, points at Marion.  The Monkey
       jumps off his shoulder and follows Marion.
66     EXT.  BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS - DAY                       66
       Marion runs along the narrow space and soon encounters a
       five foot wall. She flops over it.  The Bad Arab is
       right on her heels.  He reaches the wall and vaults over.
       On the other side of the wall, the Bad Arab lands in a
       crouch, looks ahead and doesn't see Marion.  Immediately
       a heavy earthen pot smashes over his head, putting him
       out.  Marion steps from an alcove and starts to run to-
       ward the street at the other end of the walkway.  Suddenly
       another Bad Arab and a new German Agent appear in the
       street at that end.  Before they can spot her, Marion
       retreats to the alcove again.  There is a huge rattan
       basket sitting there.  Marion climbs in and closes the
       top above her.
       The only witness:  The Monkey, who is now perched on the
       fire foot wall.
67     EXT.  THE SMALL BAZAAR - DAY                            67
       Chaos.  An entire booth of pots and pans collapses on a
       Bad Arab and a German Agent as Indy whips away a support.
68     EXT.  BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS - DAY                       68
       The chattering Monket leads a German Agent and two Bad
       Arabs to Marion's hiding place, gesturing manically.
69     EXT.  THE SMALL BAZAAR - DAY                            69
       Indy ducks under the swinging blade of a huge Arabian
       sword and kicks the Bad Arab Swordsman in the groin.
70     EXT.  SIDE STREET - DAY                                 70
       The German Agent leads the way as the two Bad Arabs carry
       the huge basket above their heads.  The basket top has
       been fastened closed, but Marion is making a fuss inside.
       At the place where the street cuts across the far side
       of the bazaar, Marion is able to wedge the top open one
       inch and screams--
                                   MARION
                     Indy-y-y-y!
71     EXT.  THE SMALL BAZAAR - DAY                            71
       Indy has heard her.  He looks across the square as the
       basket and its escorts disappear beyond a building.  One
       last Bad Arab rises before him.  Indy's whip flashes and
       the Bad Arab's robe falls down to his ankles.  Indy fran-
       tically pushes his way through the panicked mass of human-
       ity in the direction the basket has gone.
72     EXT.  THE FOOT CHASE - INTERCUTTING INDY AND THE        72
       MOVING BASKET - DAY
       The Bad Guys move the basket as fast as they can through
       streets, alleys and passageways thick with people.  Indy
       always seems to round a corner just in time to catch a
       glimpse of the basket before it disappears around a new
       corner.  Indy must fight a flow of humanity as powerful
       as an ocean riptide.  Finally, at the head of one par-
       ticularly crowded alley, Indy leaps up onto a wall for
       a clearer view.  Whatever he sees gives him an idea and
       he cuts between two buildings rather than following
       the basket.
73     EXT.  DESERTED ALLEY - DAY                              73
       Two Bad Arabs come running down the Alley with the basket
       between them.  Suddenly, Indy's whip flashes out sending
       both Arabs and the basket tumbling.  Indy steps into view,
       his .45 trained on the sprawled Arabs, and looks at the
       basket.  The top has come flying off and the contents have
       clattered onto the cobblestone:   inside is not Marion,
       but a load of contraband pistols, rifles and ammo.  Indy is
       advancing on the trembling Bad Arabs with an ugly look
       when suddenly he hears Marion scream around the corner.
74     EXT.  DESERTED SQUARE - DAY                             74
       Indy rounds the corner and is immediately driven back by
       machine gun fire.  Taking cover, he gets quick, inter-
       mittent glimpses of this scene:  At the far corner of the
       large, deserted square is a canvas-covered truck.  Two
       Bad Arabs are hurrying toward is with a large rattan bas-
       ket between them, Marion screaming inside.  A German Agent
       is covering their retreat with a machine gun from the cab
       of the truck.  Indy runs up to see the rattan basket
       being heaved into the back of the truck.
75     EXT.  BACK OF THE TRUCK - DAY                           75
       What Indy cannot see is that the basket lands among an
       ominous load of German munitions, dynamite and firearms.
       The truck immediately peels out.
76     EXT.  DESERTED SQUARE - DAY                             76
       The German Agent has stopped firing in order to drive.  He
       floors it, aiming for a street at the corner of the square.
       Indy uses the lull to take careful aim at the German Agent's
       profile and fire off three careful shots.  The German Agent
       is hit, blasted dead against the steering wheel.  The speed-
       ing truck swerves, hits a wall, rolls over and explodes in
       an enormous, multi-leveled eruption as its contents ignite.
       Several surrounding buildings are leveled.
       Indy, blown back across the square, looks on, astounded and
       horror-stricken.
                                   INDY
                     Marion.
77     INT.  ARAB BAR - NIGHT                                  77
       A dark, smoke-filled den on iniquity.  The patrons,
       almost all fearsome Arabs, sit in small shadowy groups
       around the room.  Indy stands at the bar finishing off
       a fifth of bourbon.  He is drunk.  The ARAB BARTENDER
       places a new bottle of expensive bourbon in front of him.
       Indy eyes is queerly.
                                   ARAB BARTENDER
                     The gentleman in the corner sent it.
                     He would like you to join him.
                                   INDY
                          (doesn't even look)
                     Too bad.  I'm drinking alone.
       The Arab Bartender does a take, looking at the three,
       tough GERMAN HENCHMEN who have surrounded Indy from out
       of the smoke, their hands stuffed in bulging trenchcoat pock-
       ets.  Indy notices them now with a bleary glance.  He
       decides he's in no shape to kill or be killed and moves
       with them across the room, taking his bottle with him.
       The Arab patrons take this in and mind their own business.
       The occupant of the smoke-shrouded corner table becomes
       visible only as Indy -eaches there:  it is Emile Belloq.
       He is drinking wine.
                                   INDY
                     Belloq.
                                   BELLOQ
                     Good evening, Dr. Jones.
                                   INDY
                     I ought to kill you right now.
                                   BELLOQ
                     It was not I who brought the girl
                     into this dirty business.
       Indy knows its true; that's what's tearing him up.
                                   BELLOQ
                     Sit down, please, before you fall
                     down.  We can behave as civilized
                     people.  I'm afraid it will be your
                     last opportunity.
       Indy sits, glancing at the German Henchmen, who settle
       nearby, just out of earshot.
                                   INDY
                     Not a very private place for a murder.
                                   BELLOQ
                              (looking around)
                     These Arabs will not interfere in
                     the white man's business.  They do
                     not care if we kill each other off.
                     (takes a sip of wine, refers to it)
                     Terribly difficult finding a decent
                     vintage here.  You were quite vig-
                     orous in Shanghai.  Unfortunately,
                     our friend the Wild Boar had taken
                     the precaution of making several
                     copies of the piece.
       Indy registers this as he takes a drink.  Belloq watches
       him with disdainful amusement.
                                   BELLOQ
                     How odd that is should end this way
                     for us, after so many...stimulating
                     encounters.  I almost regret it.

                     Where shall I find a new adversary
                     so close to my own level?
                                   INDY
                     Try the local sewer.
                                   BELLOQ
                     I know you despise me.  We always
                     hate in others that which we most
                     fear in ourselves.  And you and I
                     are very much alike.
                                   INDY
                     Now you're getting nasty.
                                   BELLOQ
                     We have always done the same kind of
                     work.  Our methods have not differed
                     as much as you pretend.  I am a sha-
                     dowy reflection of you.  But it would
                     have taken only a nudge to make you
                     the same as me, to push you out of
                     the light.
       There's a certain amount of truth to this; the recognition
       of it flickers across Indy's bleary eyes.  Belloq sees
       it there.
                                   BELLOQ
                     You know it to be true!  How nice.
                     And how ironic the timing.
       Belloq leans forward, eyes shining, voice suddenly different.
                                   BELLOQ
                     Do you realize that the Ark is?
                              (very intense)
                     It's a transmitter.  A radio for
                     talking to God!  And now it is
                     within my grasp.
                                   INDY
                     What about your boss, Der Fuhrer?
                     I thought he was waiting to take
                     possession.
       Belloq glances into the gloom at the German Henchmen.
                                   BELLOQ

                     When the time is right.  When I am
                     finished with it.
                                   INDY
                     I hope your friends are patient.
                     Dangerous work, Belloq.
                                   BELLOQ
                     Yes.  Very.  You may consider your-
                     self fortunate that your involve-
                     ment concludes here.
                                   INDY
                     Tell me, did you get away with
                     the idol?
                                   BELLOQ
                                 (negative)
                     I was lucky to get away with my
                     life.  The Hovitos proved quite
                     narrow-minded about the whole matter.
       Indy takes a drink.
                                   INDY
                     You know, if it's God you want to
                     talk to, maybe I can arrange it.
                                   BELLOQ
                                  (smiles)
                     You have not changed.  But, please,
                     do not reach for your weapon until
                     you are ready to die.
       The front door of the bar slams open and all nine of
       SALLAH'S CHILDREN scamper in and over to a surprised
       Indy.  Two of the smallest hop into his lap.
                                   LITTLE SON
                     Uncle Indy, we have been looking
                     for you.
                                   LITTLE DAUGHTER
                     Come home now, Uncle. Hurry!
       Suddenly the Arab patrons of the bar take an intense in-
       terest in the situation, shifting their weapons.
                                   INDY
                     Yes.  Yes, I'll come now.
       Indy stands up.  The German Henchmen and poised.  Belloq
       eyes the Arab patrons and signals for the Henchmen to relax.
                                   BELLOQ
                     Next time, Indiana Jones, it will take
                     more than children to save you.
       The children usher Indy out.
78     INT.  SALLAH'S TRUCK - IN FRONT OF ARAB BAR - NIGHT     78
       Indy climbs into the cab of Sallah's truck with a smiling
       Sallah as the children pile into the back.  Sallah pulls out.
                                   SALLAH
                     I thought we would find you there.
                              (indicating the kids)
                     Better than the United States Ma-
                     rines, eh?
                                   INDY
                                   (nods)
                     Thanks you.
                                   (grave)
                     Marion's dead.
                                   SALLAH
                     Yes, I know.  I am sorry.
                                   (pause)
                     More reason than ever to beat the
                     bastards.
                              (he touches Indy)
                     Life goes on, Indy.
                           (indicates the kids again)
                     There is the proof.
       Indy looks back there, nods.
                                   SALLAH
                     I have much to tell you, Indy.

       Fayah brings in a tray of food and puts it on the table.
       The bowl of dates is in one corner.  As Fayah leaves the
       room, the Monkey slips out of Sallah's lap and disappears
       under the table.  Indy leans over the food tray, his hand
       hovering over the dates.  But he chooses some cheese and
       bread instead.
                                   INDY
                     And they made the calculation in
                     the map room?
                                   SALLAH
                               (nods vigorously)
                     This morning.  Belloq and the boss
                     German, Shliemann.  When they came
                     out of the map room, we were given
                     a new spot in which to dig...out
                     away from the camp.
                                   INDY
                               (resigned)
                     The Well of the Souls.
       Sallah nods, moves to the food.  He picks up a date, then
       changes his mind and drops it, taking a bunch of grapes
       instead.  Indy picks up a chicken leg in one hand and a
       date in the other, his mind distracted.  Fayah enters
       the room just in time to see Indy flip the date high into
       the air and try to catch it in his mouth.  It bounces off
       his chin and falls to the floor.  Indy looks sheepishly at
       Fayah.  Fayah picks up the fallen date and puts it in the
       dirty ash tray she is now removing.  Amir speaks in a
       slow, raspy voice without looking up.
                                   AMIR
                     Come.  Look.
       The two men go and huddle over the old man.  The Monkey
       peeks up over the edge of the table at the array of food.
       He picks up a date and disappears below the table.  Amir
       points to some markings on the lower part of the headpiece.
                                   AMIR
                     This is a warning...not to disturb
                     the Ark of the Covenant.
                                   INDY
                     Just want I need.
       The Monkey's paw comes up over the edge of the table and
       grabs another date.
                                   INDY
                     How 'bout the height of the staff?
                     Did Belloq get it off of there?
                                   AMIR
                     Yes...it is here.
       Indy, nervous, goes back to the food tray, picks up another
       date.  When he turns back to the men, the Monkey's paw
       grabs another date.
       We see the headpiece in closeup on the table.  Amir's crooked
       fingers trace a line of markings along the bottom section
       to the break in the piece.
                                   AMIR
                     It says it is...ten jamirs high...
                                   SALLAH
                     About seventy-five inches.
                                   AMIR
                     Wait!  I am not finished...
       Amir's finger moves across the break as the markings con-
       tinue on the sun medallion.
                                   AMIR
                                (reading)
                     "And one jamir to honor the Hebrew
                     God whose Ark this is."
       Indy, still holding the date, exchanges a long look with
       Sallah.
                                   INDY
                     You said their top section was blank.
                     Are you absolutely sure?
       Sallah nods.
                                   INDY
                     Belloq's staff is seven and a half
                     inches short.  They're digging in
                     the wrong spot!
       Sallah and Indy begin to laugh.  Amir gives them a glance
       and returns to his wine.  Sallah leans over and kisses the
       old man.
                                   SALLAH
                                 (to Amir)
                     A home run, my friend, grand slam!
                                 (to Indy)
                     We have a saying--"A little luck is
                     better than much smartness."  Indy,
                     pardner, you are very lucky fellow.
       Indy hoots.  Then he takes the data in his hand and flips
       it high in the air.  He opens his mouth to catch it, but
       it doesn't come down.  He has inadvertently thrown it into
       a bowl of a hanging lamp.  This makes the men laugh even
       harder.
       Indy goes over and picks up another date.  He turns laugh-
       ing to Sallah and doesn't see as the Monkey's paw comes up,
       slowly, takes another date and begins to withdraw.  Sudden-
       ly the paw is stricken with palsy and the unseen Monkey
       goes into its death throws.  Sallah watches the paw as
       though hypnotized.  Finally the paw slips from sight and
       we hear a solid THUMP! on the floor.  Sallah walks around
       the table and looks at the floor.  The Monkey lies dead
       among a mess of date pits.
       Indy is in a happy world of his own.  He throws his date
       high in the air.  He positions himself under it and waits
       for it to drop in.  Here it comes.  Right on target.  As
       it's about to disappear into Indy's mouth, Sallah's hand
       flashes in and grabs it.  Indy looks mystified and disap-
       pointed.  Sallah motions toward the dead Monkey.
                                   SALLAH
                     Bad dates.
82     EXT.  DESERT ROAD - MORNING                             82
       Two old trucks come down a narrow mountain road and onto
       the flat surface of the desert.
       Further out into the desert, the one in the lead, Sallah's
       truck, stops and the second one, Omar's truck, pulls up
       beside it.  There are half dozen Arab Diggers in Omar's
       truck.  Indy, dressed as an Arab, gets out of the cab of
       Sallah's truck and moves over to confer with OMAR, another
       old friend.  They point off into the desert and reach some
       conclusion.  Indy gives him a pat on the back;  Omar turns
       off the road and drives into the desert with his workers.
       Indy hops back in the cab of Sallah's truck with Sallah.
       As they move down the road we see that the back of the
       truck holds three other Arab Diggers.
83     EXT.  RISE ABOVE THE TANIS DIGS - MORNING               83
       Indy and Sallah are lying in classic shouting fashion at
       the top of the rise looking down on the Tanis Digs.  Down
       behind them, Sallah's truck is parked with the three Arab
       Diggers.
                                   INDY
                     My God!  They aren't kidding!
       WHAT HE SEES.  The Tanis Digs are laid out below like a
       painting.  Trucks, bulldozers, Arab workers and German
       supervisors are everywhere.  The excavations themselves
       are extensive and somewhat random-holes have been dug
       and then abandoned, foundations and passageways unearthed
       and then deserted.  Beyond the main digs, a crude airstrip
       has been created.  Sallah points to what appears to be a
       mound of dirt with a hole in it near the center of the
       activity.
                                   SALLAH
                     There!  That is the map room!
                                   INDY
                     What time does the sun hit the map?
                                   SALLAH
                     Just after eight.
                                   INDY
                     We haven't got much time.  Where are
                     the Germans digging for the Well of
                     the Souls?
       Sallah points out into the desert a short way beyond the
       main area of activity.  The desert turns to sand dunes
       out there, the surface undulating into the distance.
       Several trucks and men are out there and a bulldozer is
       lumbering noisily toward it.
                                   INDY
                     Okay.  Let's go.
84     EXT.  THE TANIS DIGS - MORNING                          84
       Sallah's truck drives through the camp, one of the Arab
       Diggers at the wheel.  Indy and Sallah are in the back and
       look just like the other two Arab Diggers.  Sallah's
       truck does behind a tent and when it appears on the other
       side, Indy and Sallah are gone.
85     EXT.  AMONG THE TENTS - MORNING                         85
       Indy and Sallah move stealthily among the tents.  Indy car-
       ries a smooth wooden staff almost seven feet tall.  They
       stop between two tents and look across a path at the en-
       trance to the map room.  What appeared to be a mound of
       dirt is actually the roof on the ancient building.  The
       hole/entrance is a five-foot square skylight.  Indy looks
       around, then walks casually to the edge of the hole and
       looks inside.  Sallah joins him, producing a length of
       rope from his robes.  Indy drops the staff into the un-
       seen map room as Sallah  ties the rope around on oil drum.
       When it's secure, Indy wastes no time disappearing down
       it into the map room.
86     INT.  MAP ROOM                                          86
       Indy is down the twenty feet to the floor of the room in
       seconds.  He tugs on the rope and it immediately gets pulled
       up.  Indy looks around with real wonder and excitement.
       The room is lovely, with elaborate wall carvings and fres-
       coes, all lit by the bright stream of sunlight flooding
       in from above.  This beam of light leads Indy's eye to
       the far end, and the room's truly remarkable feature: built
       into the floor in meticulous relief is a miniature stone
       model of the ancient city of Tanis.  Already, the sunlight
       has worked its way down the far wall and is edging onto
       the miniature of the city.  On the floor, to the skylight
       side of the miniature, is an elaborate line created by
       embedded mosaic tiles.  The evenly spaced slots in the line,
       each accompanied by a symbol of a time of year, are for the
       base of the staff.  Indy pulls the headpiece from his robes--
       it has been welded together--and reaches for the staff.
87     EXT.  ABOVE THE MAP ROOM - DAY                          87
       An extremely nervous Sallah has the gathered rope in his
       hands and is trying to appear casual as he inches back to-
       ward the oil drum.  There is now a good bit of activity
       going on up here.
                                   JEEP GERMAN OS
                     Hey!  You, the skinny one!
       Sallah jumps about three feet.  The JEEP GERMAN is standing
       in an open space ten yards away looking at Sallah.
                                   JEEP GERMAN
                     Yes, you.  What are you doing there?
       Sallah gestures his innocence.
                                   JEEP GERMAN
                     Well bring that rope over here, you
                     cur.
       The Jeep German starts back toward his major concern:
       his jeep is stuck in some sand beyond the next tent.
       Some Arab Workers are trying in vain to budge it.  Now
       another German has backed his truck up to it.  Sallah
       can think of nothing to do expect obey.  With a worried
       glance at the map room, be begins untying the rope from
       the oil drum.
88     INT.  THE MAP ROOM                                      88
       Indy is examining the results of Belloq's work.  Red paint
       marks one of the miniature buildings in the layout and a
       white calibrated tape has been strung from that building
       back to a miniature of the map room.  Now Indy begins ex-
       amining the mosaic base line for the staff.  Sunlight has
       moves further down across the miniature.
89     EXT.  IN THE CAMP - DAY                                 89
       Sallah watches nervously as his precious rope is pulled
       taut between the pulling truck and the stuck jeep.  He
       doesn't notice that he has chosen to stand next to a large,
       steaming kettle of food until--
                                   HUNGRY GERMAN OS
                     Bring us some of that!
       He points to the kettle.  Sallah looks frantically from
       the rope, back to the skylight of the map room, to the
       kettle of food.
                                   HUNGRY GERMAN
                     Now, idiot!
       Sallah picks up some serving pieces and gets to work.
90     INT.  THE MAP ROOM                                      90
       The moment has arrived.  Even the tension of the circum-
       stances cannot distract Indy from the purity of what he
       is about to do.  All his calculations are adjustments com-
       plete, Indy takes the Staff of Ra and places it--CLINK!--
       in the right depression on the base line.  This is as active
       and exciting a moment as any archeologist can dream of
       and, at heart, that is exactly what Indy is.  The sunlight
       catches the very top of the headpiece and moves within a
       fraction of an inch of the tiny hole in its sun.
       The edge of the sunlight moving across the miniature city
       is still a good two feet beyond the spot Belloq has settled
       on.  And now that line of light is broken by the shadow
       of an ornate sun at the top of the staff.
       Indy's face reflects his concentration.  And then his
       immense pleasure.  He sees what he came for.
       Out of the miniature city, one small building is being
       lit by a tiny beam of sunlight in the center of the sha-
       dow of the metal sun.  And by some trick of ancient artis-
       try, this one building responds to the sunlight like none
       of the others.  The golden light permeates it: it seems
       to glow.  The building is in a direct line with Belloq's--
       all the Frenchman's other calculations were right--but it
       is a foot and a half beyond it.
91     EXT.  IN THE CAMP - DAY                                 91
       Sallah, sweating profusely, has finished serving the line
       of Breakfasting Germans and now heads back to replace the
       kettle and get away.
                                   HUNGRY GERMAN
                     Water.  Bring us water.
92     INT.  MAP ROOM                                          92
       Indy is on his knees at the miniature city, a special tape
       measure in his hand.  Indy has the tape strung from Belloq's
       mistaken spot to his own correct spot.  He gets his reading,
       leaps up and crosses to the erect staff.  He pulls the head-
       piece off the staff and hides it in his robes.  He quickly
       breaks the wooden staff in two and throws the pieces behind
       a pile of debris.  Then he moves quickly to beneath the
       skylight.
                                   INDY
                               (stage whisper)
                     Sallah.
                          (he waits, then louder)
                     Sallah!
       More waiting.  Nothing.  Indy looks around for some alter-
       native means of escape.  The room doesn't offer any.  He
       looks up at the skylight again.
                                   INDY
                                 (loudest)
                     Sallah!
       A long pause.  Then something comes down.  A makeshift
       rope.  Really just a bunch of clothing tied together--
       tunics, robes, pants.  But what we see first and most
       prominently, the first section of Indy's escape rope, is
       a bright Nazi flag.  Indy beams and climbs.
93     EXT. ABOVE THE MAP ROOM - DAY                           93
       Indy sticks his head out the skylight, sees it clear
       and flops his body out.  Sallah, crouching behind the
       oil drum, immediately starts pulling in the makeshift
       rope.  Sallah stuffs the rope in the oil drum and the
       two men begin waking toward some tents.
                                   HUNGRY GERMAN OS
                     Hey, you!  More water over here!
       Sallah glances at Indy, Then hurries back in that direc-
       tion.  The Hungry German focuses on Indy.
                                   HUNGRY GERMAN
                     Why aren't you at the digs?  Come
                     here!
       Indy bows in wild subservience and hurries off in the
       opposite direction.
                                   HUNGRY GERMAN
                          (yelling after him, irritated)
                     No, dummkopf, I said come!
94     EXT.  BETWEEN TWO TENTS - DAY                           94
       Indy hustles between the tents.  Up ahead, two German
       Officers stop to talk, blocking his exit.  He moves a-
       long the side of one of the tents until he finds an
       opening and slips inside.
95     INT.  THE TENT                                          95
       Indy finds himself in a tent set up for rather comfort-
       able living.  He has just started to cross it when he
       hears a loud, excited grunting.  He turns toward the sound.
       In the corner, tied to a chair and gagged is Marion.
       Indy rushes to her, snatches the gag from her mouth and
       embraces her.  They kiss, deep and long.
                                   INDY
                     I though you were dead.
                                   MARION
                     They were throwing me around like
                     a rag doll.
                                   INDY
                     They must have switched baskets.
                     Thank god for that!  Bless those
                     bastards.  Have they hurt you?
                                   MARION
                     No.  Not since I got here.  They
                     just asked about you--what you knew.
                     The Frenchman's got the hot's for me.
                     I've been playing that along.  Oh,
                     Indy, get me out of here.
       Indy pulls out a knife and then stops suddenly, thinking.
                                   MARION
                     What's wrong?
                                   INDY
                       (putting the knife away)
                     I have to leave you here for a little
                     while.  I know where the Ark is.  If
                     I take you out of here they'll start
                     combing the place for us.
                                   MARION
                                  (louder)
                     Cut me loose!
                                   INDY
                     Keep your voice down.
                                   MARION
                                 (screaming)
                     I said get me out of--
       Indy pops the gag back in her mouth.  Her eyes widen in
       fury and she grunts obscenities at him.
                                   INDY
                     Look, you don't know how glad I am
                     to see you.  And I don't like do-
                     ing this.  But the whole thing will
                     be shot if you don't just sit here
                     quietly.  They haven't hurt you in
                     the last twenty-four hours, they
                     aren't going to start now.  I'll be
                     back to get you in no time.
       He kisses her forehead, jumps up and hurries out of the
       tent.
96     EXT.  SAND DUNE OUTSIDE DIGS - DAY                      96
       With the digs behind them, Indy and Sallah run up to the
       ridge of the dune and over the top.  At the bottom of the
       far side, Omar's truck is parked.  Omar and his men are
       waiting.
97     EXT.  DIFFERENT DUNE - DAY                              97
       This new spot gives Indy a higher, better view of the
       whole scene.  Indy is using a surveyor's instrument to
       take a reading--
       WHAT HE SEES.  Looking through the instrument, Indy gets
       a line from the map room through the site where the Nazis
       are digging in the dunes to a spot several dunes over.
       We focus on that virgin spot of well-hidden sand as--
                                   INDY
                     There!
98     EXT.  INDY'S DIG - DAY                                  98
       Omar's truck is parked at the stop just viewed from afar.
       Dunes rise on either side.  One of Omar's men has been
       posted as a lookout up on a ridge.  Everybody else--Indy,
       Sallah, Omar, and his men--have begun digging for the
       Wells of the Souls.
                                                        DISSOLVE TO:
       SAME SCENE, NIGHT.  They continue to dig furiously, all
       of them drenched in sweat.  The hole has grown but this
       is slow, back-breaking work.
99     INT.  COMMAND TENT - TANIS DIGS - NIGHT                 99
       Belloq, SHLIEMANN the ranking Nazi, and Shliemann's Aide,
       GOBLER, come into the tent, which is full of charts and
       maps, drawings of the Ark, radio equipment, liquor and
       food.  The men have been out digging for the Well all
       day.  They are tired, discouraged, testy.  In all matters,
       Gobler shows his alliance with Shliemann against Belloq
       with small looks and body language.  The Frenchman has
       disappointed them and he is feeling the isolation of a
       scapegoat.  Belloq gets himself a drink as Shliemann towels
       off his face.
                                   BELLOQ
                     I cautioned you about being prema-
                     ture with that communique to Berlin.
                     Archeology is not an exact science.
                     If does not adhere to time schedules.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     The Fuhrer is not a patient man.  He
                     demands constant reports and he ex-
                     pects progress.  You led me to be-
                     lieve--
                                   BELLOQ
                     Nothing.  I have made no promises.
                     I said only that it looked very
                     favorable.  Perhaps the Ark will
                     still be found in an adjoining
                     chamber.  Based on the informa-
                     tion in our possession, my cal-
                     culations were correct.  Perhaps
                     some bit of evidence still eludes
                     us.  Perhaps
                                   GOBLER
                     Perhaps the girl can help us.
       Belloq shoots him an angry look.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     My feeling exactly.  She was in
                     possession of the original piece
                     for years.  She may know much.
                               (really evil)
                     If properly motivated...
                                   BELLOQ
                     I tell you, she knows nothing use-
                     ful.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     I'm surprised to find you squeamish.
                     That is not your reputation.  But
                     it needn't concern you.  I have the
                     perfect man for this kind of work.
       Shliemann signals Gobler, who steps outside the tent a
       moment, calls someone and then reappears.  Belloq looks
       warily at the entrance.  After a moment Belzig enters,
       reeking villiany.  When his eyes find Shliemann, his
       superior, he snaps a crisp "Heil, Hitler!" at him, hold-
       ing his palm rigid a long time, exposing a burned scar in
       the prefect shape of the sun medallion.
100    EXT.  INDY'S DIG - NIGHT                                100
       In the eerie conjunction of moonlight and torchlight, Indy
       and the other men step back in awe of their discovery:
       there, flush with the bottom of their pit, is a heavy
       stone entry door to an underground chamber.  Special pry-
       ing tools are produced.  With two men assigned to each of
       the two long tools, they work in unison to open the vault.
       They open it a foot and the other men rush in to flop the
       heavy door completely open.  Down inside, only blackness.
       The men quickly prostrate themselves around the edge of
       the entry to look inside.  Indy and Sallah each take a
       torch and hold them down the hole.
       WHAT THEY SEE.  The Well of the Souls is a spooky chamber
       thirty feet deep.  The walls are covered with hieroglyphics
       and carvings.  The roof is supported intermittently by
       stone pillars, the closest of which hits the roof very near
       the entry hole.  The Well is quite large; as Indy and Sallah
       wave their torches, more and more of the room is revealed.
       Now the far end of the chamber comes into view.  There is
       a stone altar down there and on this elaborated carved
       platform is a stone chest, big enough to enclose the Lost
       Ark and protect it from the ravages of time.  This altar
       appears to be the only place on the floor of the Well that
       is not covered by a strange, dark carpet of some kind.
                                   INDY
                     The Ark must be in that stone case.
                     What's that gray stuff all over the
                     floor--
       He breaks off realizing exactly what that carpet is.  He
       blanches.  Indiana Jones blanches.
       Indy drops his torch to the floor of the Well.  This is
       answered by the most horrific HISSING imaginable.
       WHAT HE SEES.  That think dark carpet is moving.  It's
       alive.  It's thousands and thousands of deadly poisonous
       snakes--Egyptian asps.  And the only thing that seems ca-
       pable of avoiding this venomous groundcover is the altar.
       The snakes ebb and flow near it, but never encroach on it,
       as though repelled by some invisible force.
       Indy shakes his head and talks to himself.
                                   INDY
                     Why snakes?  Why did it have to be
                     snakes?  Anything else.
       After a moment of this, he stops.  He gathers his energy
       and resolve and gets back to the task.
                                   SALLAH
                     Asps.  Very dangerous.
       Where Indy's torch had landed is a circle of snake-free
       floor.  The snakes hate the flame; they stay away.
                                   INDY
                     Lots of torches.  And oil.  I
                     want a landing strip down there.
101    INT.  THE WELL OF THE SOULS                             101
       Fifteen torches have been dropped to the floor of the
       chamber, combining to make a good-sized clear zone.  Smoke
       begins to fill the room.  Several canisters of oil have
       been lowered into this space.  Now, a large wooden crate
       is lowered slowly by rope.  Rope handles are attached to
       each end of the crate.
       Up at the hole, Indy gives Sallah a reassuring pat, takes
       a breath, and swings carefully onto a rope hanging from
       the hole.  Despite his care, he swings a bit and his feet
       hit the stone pillar which is so near the entry.  Surpris-
       ingly, the pillar catually moves a bit, showering a light
       rain of crumbled stone to the floor below.
       Indy lands on the floor of the Well.  He looks at the altar
       over a sea of undulating death.  He picks up an oil canister
       and splashes two parallel lines of oil and lights them.  A
       path six feet wide begins to open to the altar.  Behind
       Indy, Sallah comes quickly down the rope.
       We begin to INTERCUT all the action in the Well from here
       on with insert shots of the snakes outside the flames.
       Snakes and snakes.  We see: snakes piled and entwined six
       inches deep; mother snakes laying snake eggs; snake eggs
       hatching little snakes; snakes cannibalizing other snakes.

103    INT.  MARION'S TENT                                     103
       Belloq has been talking to the still-bound Marion.  He
       has removed her gag.  He is impatient, angry, uncomfort-
       able.  Caught between two forces.
                                   BELLOQ
                     Believe me, you make a mistake.  If
                     you would just give me something to
                     placate them.  Some bit of informa-
                     tion.
                                   MARION
                     I swear to you, I know nothing more.
                     I have no loyalty to Jones.  He's
                     brought me only trouble.
       He wants to believe her.
                                   BELLOQ
                     I cannot control them.
       Marion's frightened look shifts suddenly to the entrance
       of the tent.  There are new arrivals there--Shliemann,
       Gobler and Belzig.  Belzig carries a black leather case.
       He steps forward and smiles at Marion.
                                   BELZIG
                     We meet again, Fraulein.
104    EXT.  INDY'S DIG - JUST BEFORE DAWN                     104
       The sky is just beginning to lighten over the dunes to
       the east, making dangerously obvious the thin column of
       smoke rising from the entrance to the Well.  Omar and his
       men are peering through the smoke down into the Well.
105.   INT.  THE WELL OF THE SOULS                             105
       Indy and Sallah are on the altar.  Pushing together with
       all their strength, the heavy stone top of the protective
       chest begins to slide away.  Indy and Sallah exchange slightly
       wary but very excited looks, then continue to push.  As the
       Ark begins to be exposed, the air seems to almost vibrate,
       to become electrostatically charged.  We hear what sounds
       like a low HUM.  The sea of snakes around the altar draws
       back further from this presence.
       As the top of the stone chest is pushed completely off and
       slams down beside it, we see THE LOST ARK OF THE COVENANT.
       It is awesomely beautiful, breathtaking.  4 feet long,
       2.5 feet wide and 2.5 feet high.  It's height, however, is
       increased by the two sculptured gold angels mounted facing
       each other on the top.  Though the body of the Ark is aca-
       cia wood, it has been overlaid with gold.  An elaborate
       gold crown surrounds the top edge and gold carrying rings
       are attached to each corner.
       Sallah is mesmerized by the sight.  His hand starts to
       reach out and touch one of the angels, but Indy grabs it.
                                   INDY
                     Don't touch it!  Never touch it!
       The wooden crate stands open next to the stone chest.  Now
       Indy extracts the wooden poles from its rings and begins
       fitting them through the rings in the Ark.  This takes
       some maneuvering by the two men, but soon they are able
       to lift the Ark clear of the stone chest and into the

       wooden crate.  They extract the poles, fasten the top of
       the crate and stick the poles through the rings of the
       wooden crate.  They start back toward the space under the
       hole.
       The fire strips have begun to dwindle, as have some of
       the torches.  The snakes move slowly in toward the clear
       spaces.  Indy and Sallah eye them nervously as they hurry
       along with their heavy load.  Under the hole, they hurried-
       ly attach ropes to the wooden crate and it is pulled up.
       Indy's concentration is on the tide of snakes.
                                   INDY
                     Hurry up!  Why did it have to be
                     snakes?
       Sallah takes the next rope and climbs quickly out of the
       Well.  Indy has picked up a torch and now throws it at a
       pool of snakes who are too close for his comfort.  He turns
       and takes hold of the exit rope.  He gives it a first tug
       and it falls down into the Well, landing partly beyond the
       ring of fire where is instantly disappears in a tangle of
       angry, hissing asps.  Indy looks up at the hole.
                                   INDY
                     What the--
       Smiling down at him from the perimeter of the entry are
       Belloq, Shliemann and Gobler.
                                   BELLOQ
                     Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you
                     doing in such a nasty place?
       Belloq and the Germans laugh.
                                   INDY
                     Why don't you fellows come down
                     here?  I'll show you.
                                   BELLOQ
                     No thank you, my friend.
                            (he glances around him)
                     I think we are all very comfortable
                     up here.
106    EXT.  INDY'S DIG - DAWN                                 106
       Sunlight is flooding this tableau:  Sallah, Omar and his
       men are being held at bay by ten armed Nazis.  The wooden
       crate sits safely nearby.  Belzig and another Nazi have
       the gagged Marion held in their rough grasp.
                                   BELLOQ
                                (down to Indy)
                     After all these years, it is most
                     considerate of you to aid me in
                     this way.
       As Belloq speaks, Shliemann exchanges a look with Belzig.
       Belzig smiles and takes the gag from Marion's mouth.
107    INT.  WELLS OF THE SOULS                                107
       Shliemann smiles down at Indy.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr.
                     Jones.  Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
                     But I do not wish to leave you down in
                     that awful place...
                                  (he give a sign)
                     ...all alone.
       Belzig and the Nazi move Marion to the hole and, to Belloq's
       surprise, push her in.  Marion falls thirty feet screaming.
       Indy drops his torch, braces, and catches her!  Her weight
       knocks him to the ground, almost into the snakes.  She
       looks around at the snakes, clinging to him more desper-
       ately as he struggles to his feet trying to unload her.
                                   MARION
                     Don't put me down!
       Up at the hole, there's plenty of dissension.
                                   BELLOQ
                     The girl was mine!
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     She is of no use to us.  Only our
                     mission for the Fuhrer matters.
       Shliemann glances meaningfully around at the other Nazis.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you
                     have that clearly in mind.
       Belloq feels how much he is the outsider, his own vulner-
       ability.  He backs down with the wisdom of survival.  He
       turns to look down at Indy and Marion.  His manner is gal-
       lant.
                                   BELLOQ
                     Goodbye, mademoiselle.
                        (a pause, then with respect)
                     Indiana Jones...adieu!
       Belloq and the others step back from the hole and unseen
       Nazis slam the heavy stone door into place.  Marion screams.
       Her scream is accomanied by--
       A huge WHOOSH!  as air is sucked out and the chamber is seal-
       ed.  Half of the torches still burning go out with the sound.
       The remaining torches continue to extinguish at punctuating
       intervals throughout the following action and the snakes
       immediately flood into the newly-darkened spaces.  Indy
       puts Marion down and snatches up two burning torches.  He
       hands one to Marion.
                                   INDY
                     Don't panic.  There's plenty of time
                     for that later.  Wave that at any-
                     thing that slithers.
       Indy holds his torche out like a lantern and begins a slow
       360o turn, his eyes peering into the gloom, examining every
       inch of wall and ceiling.
                                   MARION
                     What are you doing?
                                   INDY
                     Just watch the floor.
       Reminded of the encroaching snakes, Marion waves her torch
       at the nearest edge of their circle.  She looks faint.  In-
       dy continues his slow turn.
                                   MARION
                     Whatever you're doing, do it faster.
                                   INDY
                            (he spots something)
                     There!
       His head whips around, looking at the pillars around the
       room.  He sees what he wants.  He grabs one of the oil
       canisters, looks back to the spot on the wall he's chosen
       and splashes oil on the floor in that direction, then lights
       it.  A path opens toward that wall.
                                   INDY
                     Come on!
       Marion is frozen in her spot.  Indy drags her after him.
       He splashes oil the rest of the way to the wall.  It lights
       and Indy pulls Marion over to the wall.  He pours the re-
       maining oil in a circle around them, creating a safe zone
       there.
                                   INDY
                     Stay here!
                                   MARION
                               (grabbing him)
                     Where are you going?
                                   INDY
                     I'll be back in a minute.  We're
                     going through this wall.
       Marion looks at the wall, which looks like all the rest
       to her.  She thinks he's crazy.
                                   INDY
                     Just keep your eyes open and get
                     ready to run.  No matter what happens
                     to me.
                                   MARION
                                 (panicked)
                     What do you mean?
       Too late.  Indy runs back through the path of flames to
       the center of the room.  Snakes strike as his flying heels.
       Indy reaches the base of the pillar which he touched briefly
       on his original descent.  He uses his torch to clear
       away the scattered snakes climbing on it, then pulls out
       his whip.  He draws it back, then wraps is solidly around
       the pillar 15 feet up.  With the torch in his mouth, he
       begins climbing the pillar.  It moves ominously under his
       weight.
       The last two torches still burning on the floor go out.
       Now the only light in the chamber is provided by the torches
       held by Indy and Marion and the dwindling oil flames.  Snakes

       move in and surround the base of Indy's pillar.  The path
       between Marion and the center of the room is overrun.  The
       circle of flame around Marion is dying down.  She looks be-
       yond it with terror-widened eyes, then up through the in-
       creasing smoke at the distant Indy.
       Near the top of the pillar, Indy's hands strain along his
       taut whip, which he has moves higher. A snake slithers
       into view there, inches from Indy's straining face.  Indy
       turns his head so the torch in his mouth can burn it.  The
       snake falls from the pillar.  Indy's torch is dwindling.
       Indy works his body around so that he in on the side of
       the pilar away from Marion.  The pillar moves, showering
       dust.  Indy looks at the chamber wall five feet away, takes
       a breath and swings his legs up against it.  He is now
       braced between pillar and wall.
                                   MARION OS
                                  (screaming)
                     Where are you?!
       Snakes are moving in force up the pillar toward Indy's
       dwindling torch.  Indy grasps the pillar for dear life,
       grimaces with exertion and pushes against the wall with
       all he's got.  The pillar begins to break loose of the
       ceiling, then stops.  Indy's eyes are on the torch.  It
       is just a spot of flame now.  Snakes are sliding up to-
       ward his hands.  Indy again pushes against the wall and
       the torch falls out of his mouth.
       The pillar goes!  In the dim light, we see it fall like
       a tree directly at Marion.  Indy rides it down.  The top
       hits the wall three feet from a cringing Marion and smashes
       through to a black chamber beyond. Indy flies off into
       the darkness.  Gone.  Marion clutches her torch at the
       black hole.
                                   MARION
                     Indy!  Where are you?!  Please Lord!
       There is a moment that seems an eternity, then Indy ap-
       pears like an apparition out of the void.
                                   INDY
                     Come on!
       He grabs her and helps her over the remains of the wall
       into--
108    INT.  THE CATACOMBS                                     108
       The winding  string of connected chambers is revealed to
       them only a few feet at a time as their torch lights the
       way.
                                   MARION
                     The snakes...are they here?
                                   INDY
                     I guess not.  I think I'd be dead.
                                   MARION
                     Do you know where you're going?
                                   INDY
                     Absolutely.
                                   MARION
                     Thank god.  Where?
                                   INDY
                     Out.
       They round a corner and flush a covey of bats.  Marion
       screams.
                                   INDY
                     Don't do that.  It scares me.
       Marion gives him a look.  They round a corner and begin
       a walk through a maze of chambers that present for their
       inspection:  moldering mummies and stacked saracophagi;
       a room decorated with a thousand human skulls; a wall
       crawling with huge scarabaeid beetles.  Marion is quite
       naturally a nervous wreck; she jumps when Indy grabs her
       suddenly and points.
                                   INDY
                     Look!
       WHAT THEY SEE.  There, coming through the crack in the
       corner of the next chamber, is white blessed sunlight.
109    EXT.  THE TANIS DIGS - NEAR AIRSTRIP - DAY              109
       Indy and Marion peek out into the light from the shadows
       of an abandoned excavation.  Before them is the improvised
       airstrip serving the digs: a crude runway, a tent supply
       depot, two fuel tank trucks.  Down by the fuel trucks a
       German Mechanic is looking skyward.  Now Indy and Marion
       look there too, drawn by the roaring sound of--
       A Flying Wing, which is circling over the digs in prepar-
       ation to landing.
       Now a new figure approaches the German Mechanic.  It is
       Gobler; he yells to the mechanic, indicating the plane.

                                   GOBLER
                     Get is gasses immediately!  It has
                     an important cargo to take out!
       In the distance, the Flying Wing lands and rolls toward
       the men.  Gobler spins and heads back toward the main camp,
       which is hidden from view by a rise.  Indy and Marion watch
       him go.
                                   INDY
                     When the Ark gets loaded, we're al-
                     ready going to be on that place.
       The Flying Wing rolls up into the space near the fuel trucks.
       The German Mechanic puts blue blocks in front of the tires
       as the engines continue to roar.
       Indy and Marion run in a crouch to a hiding spot closer to
       the plane, near the supply tent.  Suddenly, a Second German
       Mechanic appears behind them.  He is as surprised as they
       are, but recovers quickly and swings a big monkey wrench
       at Indy.  Indy grabs the swinging arm and the two men tum-
       ble out into the open, wrestling.  Marion remains hidden,
       moving fast among the crates.
       The first German Mechanic, who is just pulling the fuel hose
       from the tank truck to the plane, sees the combatants and
       runs to help his countryman.  He is almost upon them when
       Indy puts the Second German away with a devastating left--
       right--left combination.  He turns to find the first German
       Mechanic flying at him.  The roll toward the rear of the
       Flying Wing and its lethally spinning reversed propellers.
       In the cockpit of the Flying Wing, the Pilot has been fid-
       dling with his gauges just prior to shutting off his engines.
       Now he notices the fight going on outside.
       The fistfight between Indy and the German Mechanic has taken
       on a new stomach-tightening dimension.  The men are fighting
       and flailing in and out between the spinning props at the
       back of the plane's wings.  Each man comes within inches of
       becoming instant mincemeat.
       The Pilot slides away the top of his cockpit and stands up.
       He pulls a Luger from his side and points it, waiting for
       a clear shot at Indy.  The German Mechanic kicks Indy away
       from him and the Pilot aims his pistol.  Suddenly, Marion
       appears behind the Pilot, standing on the opposite wing,
       and bashes him over the head with one of the blue blocks
       that was holding the tires.  The Pilot drops down into
       the cockpit, his body falling on the throttle.  The engines
       roar louder, revving up.  The plane begins to roll, rotat-
       ing around its one still-blocked set of tires.  Marion grabs
       onto the cockpit to keep from slipping into the props.  She
       bends into the cockpit, trying to pull the Pilot's body off
       the throttle.  No luck.  She grimaces and climbs inside.
       Her shoulder bumps the top of the cockpit; it slides tight-
       ly shut above her.
       Under the moving wing, Indy delivers a knockout rightcross
       to the German Mechanic which sends him staggering back to-
       ward a roaring propeller.  Indy's grimace registers the man's
       demise and a fine mist of blood wafts toward him.  Indy
       spins toward the sound of crumpling metal and sees--
       The other top of the Flying Wing slice into a tank truck.
       The airplane fuel inside floods out onto the pavement,
       surrounding the plane.  Indy backpedals away from the plane,
       his eyes searching the scene for Marion.  Suddenly, he is
       shocked to see her in the cockpit.  He runs toward her,

       skidding through the gasoline.
                                   INDY
                     Get out!  Get out!
       Marion is struggling with the top of the cockpit.  She
       can't budge it.  She's trapped.
110    EXT.  THE COMMAND TENT - DAY                            110
       Three Armed Nazis stand guard around the wooden crate con-
       taining the Ark.  It is sitting near the flopped-open en
       trance to the Commmand Tent and there is furious activity
       going on here.  Belloq, Shliemann, Gobler, Belzig and as-
       sorted Aides are packing up all the papers and personal
       items in preparation for a hasty departure.
       A large crowd of Arab Diggers is milling about among the
       tents.  They all want to get a look at the Ark.  Sallah is
       among them.  All at once, there is a earthshaking explo-
       sion.  Al eyes turn toward the rise that hides the air-
       strip.  A huge fireball floats into view over there.  Every-
       one starts running toward it.  Shliemann yells at Belzig
       and the Armed Nazis.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     Stay with the Ark!
111    EXT.  THE RISE ABOVE AIRSTRIP - DAY                     111
       Almost all the Arabs and Germans in the digs have congre-
       gated here and are staring at the burning remains of the
       Flying Wing.  Belloq and Shliemann arrive just as the sec-
       ond fuel truck blows up.  The concussion knocks many of
       the observers flat.  Belloq, Shliemann and Gobler watch
       the scene in alarm.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     Sabotage!
                                   BELLOQ
                     We must get the Ark away from this
                     place immediately!
                                   SHLIEMANN
                                  (to Gobler)
                     Have it put on the truck.  We'll fly

                     out of Cairo.
       Gobler snaps his heels, turns to go.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     And Gobler--
                                 (Gobler stops)
                     -- I want plenty of protection.
       Gobler nods and runs off.  Shliemann heads back toward camp.
       Belloq hesitates a long moment, studying the burning wreck-
       age with an odd, suspicious look.  Finally, he turns and
       leaves, passing a nearby stack of barrels.  When he has
       passed, Sallah appears from among the barrels.  He searches
       the crowd for his people and starts a broken field run along
       some tents to avoid a group of Germans and is running flat-
       out when someone sticks out a leg and sends him flipping.
       Sallah, dust all over his face, looks angrily toward the
       concealed culprit.  At once, a flashing white grin splits
       his darkened face.  Indy and Marion, splotched with soot
       and oil, are hiding in the flap of a tent.  Sallah runs in-
       to their arms and the three embrace warmly.  When they break--
                                   SALLAH
                     Holy smoke, my friends!  I am so
                     pleased you are not dead.
                                   MARION
                     Us too.
                                   SALLAH
                         (suddenly remembering)
                     The Ark!  They're taking it on a
                     truck to Cairo.
                                   INDY
                     Where is it?
       Sallah gestures to follow and all three run off stealthily
       through the mostly deserted camp.
112    EXT. AMONG THE TENTS - DAY                              112
       Sallah, Indy and Marion run into a hiding spot behind some
       water barrels near the Command Tent.  They peek out at this
       activity--
       In the big space near the Command Tent is parked an open
       German staff car; inside is a Blond Driver and an Armed
       Guard.  Directly behind it is a canvas-topped troop truck.
       At this moment, Belloq and Shliemann are supervising the
       careful placement of the crated Ark in the back of the
       truck.  When it is securely placed inside, we hear an om-
       inous marching sound and Nine Armed Nazis appear at a
       trot from between some tents and climb into the back of the
       truck with the Ark.
       Behind the water barrels, Sallah and Marion exchange hape-
       less looks,  But Indy just concentrates on--
       The scene by the truck: Belloq and Shliemann are about to
       climb into the front staff car when they pause to check out
       the final component of the convoy.  Rolling into place be-
       hind the truck is another open staff car.  But this one is
       special--mounted in the back is a big, black machine gun,
       manned by a Gunner.  At the wheel of the car is Gobler and
       next to him sits Belzig.
       Sallah and Marion look at Indy.  Belloq and Shliemann climb
       in  the back seat of the front car and the caravan pulls
       out.  Indy watches it go, thinking hard.
                                   INDY
                     You two get back to Cairo quick and
                     get us transporation to England--
                     a plane, a ship, anything.
                                   MARION
                     What about you?
                                   INDY
                     I'm going to get that truck.  I'll
                     meet you at Omar's.  Be ready for me.
       Sallah nods.  Marion looks at him like he's nuts.  Indy jumps
       up, looks around desperately.
                                   MARION
                     How are you going to get that truck?
                                   INDY
                             (still searching)
                     I don't know.  I'm making this up
                     as I go.
       He runs away between two tents.
113    EXT. AT THE EDGE OF THE DIGS - DAY                      113
       From among the tents, Indy suddenly bursts into view, hap-
       pily astride a magnificent white Arabian stallion.  He gal-
       lops off across the desert.
114    EXT.  THE DESERT (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY                  114
       Indy cuts crosscountry avoiding the road the convoy has
       taken.  He leaps gullies, climbs dunes, slides down slopes.
       Soon the convoy comes into view far below him.  He tears
       along a parallel ridge, like an Indian shadowing a wagon
       train.
115    EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY                                 115
       The convoy is entering rougher country.  The narrow moun-
       tain road we've seen earlier ascends ahead.  To the side
       of the road are tall boulders.  Suddenly, Indy shoots out
       from between two rocks and rides directly for the truck.
       The Armed Nazis in the back of the truck can see nothing
       because the canvas hides their view.  But Gobler, Belzig
       and the Gunner in the rear staff car have a brief line on
       him.  Belzig points and the Gunner fires away and Indy, the
       bullets kicking up sand near Indy's horse.
       The Armed Guard in the cab of the truck leans out to see
       what's happening.  Indy has been riding alongside.  Now
       he stands on the horse and leaps to the cab.  In a second,
       he has flipped the Armed Guard out of the truck.  He slides
       into the cab and begins grappling with the Truck Driver.
       The Truck Driver tries to hit the brakes, but Indy kicks
       his foot away and floors the gas pedal.  The truck doubles
       its speed and shoots onto the steep mountain road.
116    EXT.  MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY                               116
       The Blond Driver of the front staff car sees the truck move
       up on him in the rearview mirror and speeds up.  Belloq,
       Shliemann and the Armed Guard in the car twist around to
       look at the struggle in the truck.  The Blond Driver begins

       what will be a continuing preview of the twists in the road.
       He turns his wheel sharply and takes the lead car around
       a bend.
       In the cab of the truck, Indy and the Truck Driver stop
       their fight temporarily and cooperate in turning the steer-
       ing wheel.  The truck barely stays on the road.
       A full view reveals the incredible geography of this ride.
       The convoy in tiny against the spectacular mountainside,
       the cliffs drop hundreds of feet.
       At the wheel of the rear car, Gobler swerves to stay on
       the road and accidently sideswipes a boulder.  The Gunner
       perched in the back is flipped head over heels out of the
       car.  Gobler and Belzig are having trouble seeing the road
       through all the dust the convoy is kicking up.
       The lead staff car reaches the summit of the road and bare-
       ly makes the hairpin turn there, delivering a destructive
       blow to the guard rail that has been placed there.  The
       guard rail is now bent.
       In the cab of the truck, Indy and the Truck Driver again
       stop trying to choke each other long enough to negotiate
       the turn together.  The bumper of the truck hits the bro-
       ken guard rail and sends it flying off the cliff.  The
       truck, however, holds the road.
       In the rear car, Gobler and Belzig are trying to see through
       the thick clouds of dust.  Suddenly is clears completely.
       Unfortunately for them, this happens because their car
       has shot out into space at the hairpin turn.  They are
       flying to their final reward.  Belzig, eyes wide behind
       his evil spectacles, screams as he goes.
       In the cab of the truck, the Truck Driver is distracted
       by the sight of the flying staff car.  Indy plasters him
       and he tumbles out.
       Far, far below, Belzig's staff car explodes on the rocks.
       In the back of the truck, a TOUGH SERGEANT takes command
       of the situation.  He picks out six Armed Nazis and motions
       for them to start climbing around the outside of the
       truck to the cab.  With some trepidation the lucky ones
       begin that maneuver.  The truck is swerving like crazy.
       In the front staff car, the Armed Guard aims his submachine
       guns back at Indy, alone now in the truck's cab.  Shliemann
       knocks the barrel roughly away.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                                   (yelling)
                     If anything happens to that Ark,
                     we're all dead men !  The Fuhrer
                     will see to it!
       Indy sees this from the cab and reacts by speeding up, put-
       ting even more pressure on the Blond Driver.
       Along the back of the truck, Armed Nazis are edging up to-
       ward the cab, three on each side.  They hang on as the
       truck rounds a corner and goes into a straightaway that
       leads through a short tunnel.
       In the cab, Indy has been concentrating on the lead staff
       car.  Now, just before entering the tunnel, he looks in
       the side view mirror and sees the Nazis on his side.  A
       quick glance to the other mirror reveals the others.  As
       the truck sweeps into the tunnel, we see Indy just start
       to turn his steering wheel--he is going to sideswipe the
       walls of the tunnel
       At the other end of the tunnel, we hear the roar of the
       two engine and two long, screeching, scraping sounds.  The
       lead staff car shoots out of the tunnel, then the truck,
       its sides cleaned of Nazis.
       In the rear of the truck, the Tough Sergeant is looking
       with distaste back at the tunnel.  There remains only him
       and two Armed Nazis with the Ark.  He sends these two climb-
       ing up over the top of the truck.
       In the lead car, the Blond Driver is being pressed hard
       by Indy, who now edges up to bump them from the rear.  Sud-
       denly the Armed Guard next to the Driver sees the two Armed
       Nazis appear on the top of the truck.  Without thinking,
       he starts to point them out to Shliemann, then realizes
       his stupidity.
       In the cab, Indy has seen this and is at first mystified.
       He checks his sideview mirrors.  Then he figures it out
       and slams on his brakes.  The brakes lock, the wheels burn
       and the truck skids to a dusty halt.  The two Armed Nazis
       fly off the truck, over the cab to the road in front.
       Indy immediately hits the gas again.  The two Armed Nazis,
       just aiming their weapons, get wiped out.
       In the rear of the truck, the crated Ark is bouncing all
       along, no one in sight, because--
       The Tough Sergeant is on the top of the truck, making his
       way steadily forward.  This guy clearly knows what he's
       doing.  A submachine gun is slung across his back.
       The truck and the staff car race through a series of
       S-curves.  In the staff car, Belloq and Shliemann spot the
       Tough Sergeant as he reaches the front of the truck's top
       and begins to lower his submachine gun barrel toward the
       cab.  Indy is unaware.  Bellow and Shliemann exchange looks.
       Then Shliemann yells to the Armed Guard in the front seat.
       The Tough Sergeant has a line on Indy.  He points his gun.
       The Armed Guard blasts away at the truck.  The Tough Ser-
       geant dies in a hail of bullets and flies off.
       Indy, who has ducked at the gunfire, is confused.  But when
       he sees the Armed Guard up front lower his gun, Indy again
       floors it and begins bumping the staff car in earnest.
       The road is almost down to a level now.  In the distance--
       Cairo.  The road takes a little dogleg just before reach-
       ing level ground again.  Just as the staff car is about to
       make the turn, Indy smashes them from behind.  The staff
       car flies off the road and down a twenty foot embankment.
       Indy takes the truck speeding down the road and off toward
       Cairo.
       In the staff car, the occupants are bruised but safe.
       Shliemann points at the departing truck and yells at the Blond
       Driver.  The staff car fishtails out of its sandy resting
       place and takes off after the truck.
117    EXT.  OUTSKIRTS OF CAIRO (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY          117
       Indy has an ever-decreasing lead on the staff car as the
       race thunders into the narrow streets.  People and animals
       leap out of the way; carts and barrels go flying helter
       skelter.  Indy takes the truck down a street so narrow
       there are only inches to spare on each side.  Pedestrians
       jump into doorways.
118    EXT.  OMAR'S SQUARE - DAY                               118
       When the truck clears the narrow street, it is in a small
       square.  Omar's garage  s gaping open on the opposite side.
       Indy hits the brakes and the truck skids across the square
       and into the garage.  The garage door slams shut and tent-
       ing drops from the building to hide the door. Various arabs,
       friends of Omar, rush out with fruit carts and baskets
       and set up a mini-bazaar in seconds.  Two Arab Boys sweep
       the tracks of the truck into obliviion.  They throw aside
       their brooms just as the staff car appears from the narrow
       street.  Belloq and Shliemann look around desperately as
       the Blond Driver steers the car through the square and out
       the other side.
119    EXT.  CAIRO DOCKS - NIGHT                               119
       The waterfront is dark and misty.  An old tramp steamer,
       THE BANTU WIND, sits by the pier.  Several fierce Black
       African Pirates, the crewmembers, are taking on final
       stores.
       A small light illuminates the top of the gangplank.  In
       its circle, Indy and Marion exchange long, warm embraces
       with Sallah.  A short distance away the ship's Captain, a
       handsome, powerful black named SIMON KATANGA, watches from
       the rail, smoking a pipe.
                                                        DISSOLVE TO:
120    EXT.  OPEN SEA - THE MEDITERRANEAN - NIGHT              120
       The Bantu Wind is bathed in moonlight as it cuts across
       even seas.
121    INT.  INDY'S CABIN - NIGHT                              121
       Indy comes in, takes off his hat, jacket, whip and holster.
       The door which connects this cabin to the next opens and
       Marion appears.  She is carrying a half-full glass of
       liquor, but what you notice is the long, snow-white, high-
       necked nightgown she is wearing.  It is very prim.  Very
       innocent.  And very sexy.  Marion does a slightly embarrassed
       model's turn for Indy.
                                   MARION
                     I have a feeling I'm not the first
                     woman to travel with these pirates.
                     There's a whole wardrobe in there.
                                   INDY
                     It's lovely.
       Indy sits on the cot, takes off his boots.  He leans back
       against the wall and rubs his eyes.  Marion sits on the
       bed, leans back against the wall with him and looks down
       at her white nightgown.  She chuckles.
                                   MARION
                     I feel like a virgin bride in this.
                                   INDY
                     That's what you look like.
                                   MARION
                              (takes a drink)
                     There are some things you can recap-
                     ture in this life, but that isn't
                     one of them.
                                   INDY
                     What would you like to recapture?
                                   MARION
                            (after a long pause)
                     Nothing.  That is the way it is.
       He watches her closely as she drains her glass and puts
       it down.
                                   INDY
                     Did I ever say I was sorry I burned
                     down your tavern?
       She turns so their lips are very close.
                                   MARION
                     No.  Then again, I burned up that
                     plane.
                                   INDY
                     You saved my life.
                                   MARION
                     And you saved mine.
                                   INDY
                     Seems things have worked out kind of
                     even.
                                   MARION
                     That's the way I like them.
                                   INDY
                     Maybe we should consider all past
                     accounts closed.
       Marion thinks about this a long time.
                                   MARION
                     No.  Not yet.
                                   INDY
                     What else?
       She looks into his eyes.  A smile jumps from her lips to
       his.  He kisses her and they sink slowly to the cot.
122    INT.  IN THE HOLD                                       122
       The ship's rats are agitated.  They tremble and chitter
       at the edges of the compartment, darting about.  Out in
       the center of the hold, sitting all by itself, is the
       crated Ark.   HUM-M-M-M.
123    INT.  INDY'S CABIN - DAY                                123
       Marion awakes with a start, alone in the cot.  Something's
       wrong.  The ship is quiet.  Indy is strapping on his holster.
       He pulls his ship and jacket from a hook.
                                   MARION
                     What is it?
                                   INDY
                     The engines have shut down.
                                   MARION
                     Why?
                                   INDY
                     I'm going to find out.
124    EXT.  LOWER DECK - DAY                                  124
       Indy runs toward the bow, then climbs some steps four at
       a time.  A MESSENGER PIRATE is hurrying to get him, but
       flies by him on the steps.  By the time the Pirate stops
       himself, Indy is gone.
                                   MESSENGER PIRATE
                     Mister Jones!  The Captain he say--
125    EXT.  THE BRIDGE - DAY                                  125
       Captain Katanga is looking with concern ahead of the ship.
       Indy appears behind him.
                                   INDY
                     What's wrong?
                                   KATANGA
                     You have most important friends.
       Katanga turns quickly, pointing with a sweeping hand.  Indy
       looks.  Arrayed in a rough semicircle around the ship are
       ten German Wolf Submarines.  All of their deck guns are
       manned and trained on the Bantu Wind.  Worse, at least five
       heavily-armed boarding parties in rafts are closing quickly
       on the ship.
                                   INDY
                     Holy shit.
                                   KATANGA
                                    (fast)
                     I sent my man for you.  You and the
                     girl must disappear.  We have a place
                     in the hold.  Go, my friend!
126    EXT.  UPPER DECK - DAY                                  126
       Indy tears along the deck. He looks over the rail and
       sees two Nazi rafts already next to the ship.
127    EXT.  LOWER DECK - DAY                                  127
       Indy flies down some stairs and starts to round a corner.
       Suddenly he throws himself backwards, out of view.  Three
       uniformed Nazis are clustered near a cabin door holding
       the Messenger Pirate.  Now two more come out of the cabin
       trying to maintain their grasp on a kicking, yelling Marion.

       She is still wearing her white nightgown.  More Nazis clam-
       ber onto the deck and head toward Indy, slamming open doors,
       rousting Pirates, spouting racial epithets.  Indy steps
       backwards and fades into the maze of the ship.
128    EXT./INT.  THE BANTU WINDS (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY        128
       The ship is swarming with Nazis.  The Black Pirates are
       herded forward, subjected to rough physical and verbal
       abuse by the Aryan Supermen.  The Pirates are clearly
       under orders not to resist, but not one of these strong
       men likes it.  They'd gladly give their lives to rip the
       throat out of a few Krauts.  In the hold, the door slams
       open and Nazis pour in; they smile at the sight of the
       crated Ark.
129    EXT.  THE BRIDGE - DAY                                  129
       Captain Katanga watches as his crew is crowded into a cir-
       cle of Nazis on the wide deck below him.  He is surrounded

       by Belloq, Shliemann, and several Nazis, two of whom are
       holding Marion.  Now the Nazis from the hold appear on the
       lower deck carrying the crated Ark by means of the long
       poles.  Belloq's eyes shine at the sight.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     Take it aboard the Wurrfler!
                                   BELLOQ
                     And be very careful!
       The Ark is taken away.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                              (to a Sergeant below)
                     What about Jones?
                                   SERGEANT
                     Not a trace yet, sir!
                                   KATANGA
                     Jones is dead.
       Belloq and Shliemann regard him suspiciously.
                                   KATANGA
                     We killed him.  He was of no use to
                     us.  The girl, however, has certain
                     value where we are headed.  She will
                     bring a very good price.  If that
                     cargo you have taken was your goal,
                     then go in peace with it.  But leave
                     us the girl.  It will reduce our loss
                     on this trip.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     Savage.  You are not in a position
                     to ask for anything.  We will take
                     what we wish and then decide whether
                     or not to slow your ship from the
                     water.
       Belloq steps forward and puts a proprietory hand on Marion's
       arm, fixing Shliemann with a steady look.
                                   BELLOQ
                     That girl goes with me.  It will be
                     part of my compensation.  I'm sure
                     the Fuhrer would approve.
       Shliemann considers.
                                   BELLOQ
                     If she fails to please me, you can
                     do with her as you wish.
       This appeals to Shliemann's nature.  He signals his agree-
       ment with a gesture.  Belloq ushers Marion away with her
       two keepers.
                                                        DISSOLVE TO:
130    EXT.  "THE WURRFLER" - CONNING TOWER - DAY              130
       The Nazis have returned to their subs.  Shliemann is on
       the bridge with THE WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN and the Captain's
       Aides.  The Captain is an honorable career Navy man.
                                   THE WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN
                     Colonel Shliemann, all torpedoes
                     are loaded.
       Shliemann nods and continues to stare at the Bantu Wind,
       as does the Captain.  The Pirate crew is all lined across
       the bow.  Towering above the others, standing on the rail,
       proud and defiant, is Katanga.  Shliemann looks at the
       Wurrfler's Captain a moment.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     What do you think, Captain?
                                   THE WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN
                                   (earnestly)
                     I think not, Colonel.  Nothing is
                     to be gained.  We are not at war.
       Shliemann mulls this, then turns to the hatch.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     ...yet.  Let the vermin live.  We
                     must be on our way.
       Shliemann disappears down the hatch.  The Captain is very
       pleased.  A Radioman speaks into his headset, then follows
       the other Aides down the hatch.  In the distance the other
       subs begin to move away from the ship.  The Captain, alone
       on the bridge, looks once more at Katanga.
       On the Bantu Wind, Katanga executes what might be taken
       for a salute.
       The Wurrfler's Captain smiles, salutes crisply, then goes
       below, pulling the hatch closed.  Immediately, the Wurrfler
       begins to move.  And as it does, we see the rail at the aft
       of the main deck.  From nowhere, a wet sleeve appears and
       a hand grabs the rail!
       Indy pulls his dripping body onto the sub's main deck.  He
       has lost his felt hat once and for all.  Other than that,
       his outfit is the same as always, just wetter.  Suddenly,
       water is washing over his feet; the Wurrfler is beginning
       to submerge.  Indy runs through quickly deepening water
       toward the haven of the conning tower.  Halfway there, he
       slips and goes down.  Only by grabbing the base of the
       aftmast light does he keep from being swept away.  He strug-
       gles to his feet and sloshes through knee-deep water to the
       base of the conning tower.
       Indy climbs the ladder to the bridge of the conning tower
       and looks down.  The water is rising toward his fast.  Indy
       climbs the ladder to the top of the turret and braces him-
       self between the two uprights there--the 7 foot radio mast
       and the 20 foot periscope.  Still the ocean comes up to
       meet him.  Soon the top of the turret is under water and
       the radio mast is disappearing.  Indy shifts his grip to
       the periscope, working his way up it and hanging on for
       dear life as the ocean whips at his body.  The periscope is
       quickly going under.  Indy hangs on to the top three feet,
       all that remains above.
       The forward movement of the sub continues, but, to Indy's
       slowly dawning delight, the dive stops.  No more of the
       periscope goes under.  Indy smiles; it's a pretty good
       smile, too, given the circumstances.  Indy pulls out his
       bullwhip and begins  tying himself to the periscope.
131    EXT.  THE PERISCOPE - AFTERNOON                         131
       The sun warms that part of his body Indy has contrived to
       keep out of the water.  The rest floats out behind.  Indy
       isn't comfortable, but all in all, it's not as terrible
       as he might have feared.
                                                        DISSOLVE TO:
132    EXT.  THE PERISCOPE - DUSK                              132
       It's as terrible as Indy might have feared.  He looks
       wasted.  Waterlogged and exhausted.  The wet leather of
       the whip is contracting and he must struggle constantly
       to keep it from cutting into his skin.
                                                        DISSOLVE TO:
133    EXT.  THE OCEAN - NIGHT                                 133
       Several shark fins cut the surface, appearing and disap-
       pearing in the bright moonlight.  They are shadowing--
134    EXT.  THE PERISCOPE - NIGHT                             134
       Indy looks through barely open eyes at the sharks running
       alongside.  There is nothing to be done.  His eyes close.
                                                        FADE OUT.
                                                        FADE IN:
135    EXT.  THE PERISCOPE - NIGHT                             135
       The submarine has stopped.  The water is calm.  The moon
       is bright.  A gentle swell splashes Indy awake.  He blinks,
       tries to regain his senses.  He makes an inventory of his
       body.  Surprised to find himself intact, his spirits lift.
       Some hidden reserve of energy flows through him.  He frees
       his aching arms from the wet leather of his whip, leaving
       only one loop around his waist to hold him to the sub.  He
       rubs his hands and stretches.  Once again, he has survived.
       To fight again.  He looks around.
       WHAT HE SEES.  A lovely island.  No sign of man's presence.
       The sub has stopped at the mouth of a wide cove completely
       ringed by tall white rock cliffs.  Suddenly the sub begins
       to move again.  It is headed directly toward the center of
       the cliffs.  Indy holds on, mystified, alert.  When the
       cliffs are very close, the sub begins to dive.
                                   INDY
                     Damn!
       He thinks hard.  Inspiration hits just before the water.
       Indy flips his leather jacket up over his head and holds
       the jacket out in front of him.  His head is hidden by the
       jacket as he goes under water.
136    INT.  THE UNDERWATER TUNNEL - NIGHT                     136
       The sub enters an underwater tunnel that penetrates into
       the cliffs.  Indy is held to the periscope by his crossed
       legs and the whip.  His impromptu air bubble is working,
       but it's a struggle to maintain it.
       The sub begins to cut through think marine vegetation.
       Each dangling growth pulls at Indy's body and slaps at his
       leather bubble.  Now a clump of entwined seaweed rips the
       leather out of his hands and his bubble of air rises away.
       Indy hangs on, holding his breath, but the vegetation gets
       denser.  Finally, it pulls him off the periscope.  The
       sub moves on, disappearing ahead.
       Indy rises desperately through the dark water, his hand
       outstretched.  Then, almost simultaneously, hand and head
       hit solid rock.  But no air.  Indy feels along the ceiling
       of rock.  Nothing.  It's all submerged.
       Indy dives, stroking deep into the tunnel.  When he has
       descended 15 feet, he grabs a vine and steadies himself.
       His eyes search the dim roof of the tunnel.  He sees his
       last hope in the distance--a small blue circle, an air
       pocket.  He swims for it.
       In the air pocket, Indy's head breaks the surface and
       smashes into rock again.  The pocket is only six inches
       deep.  No matter.  Indy loves it.  He'd like to move in.
       He gulps air.
137    INT.  THE SUB BASE - DOCKING BAY                        137
       The Wurrfler has arrived at an extraordinary base built
       in the hollow interior of the island.  This chamber, with
       the docking bay, is almost all water.  A huge natural cav-
       ern, it has been reinforced and enlarged by the Germans.
       The Wurrfler sits surfaced at the dock.  The Ark has been
       unloaded and placed on a cart.  Shliemann, Belloq and Marion
       have just disembarked and been met by a Nazi contingent
       from the base.  Marion looks worse for the trip. Her white
       nightgown is now ripped and smudged.
       One of the greeting Nazis, a TALL CAPTAIN, salutes Shlie-
       mann and Belloq.  As he speaks to them, we notice that right
       behind this group, just above a great deal of sub unloading
       activity, Indy's whip hangs from the periscope. Working
       Nazis pass within feet of it unaware; the Tall Captain would
       see it in a moment if he were not so focused on the new
       arrivals.
                                   TALL CAPTAIN
                                   (to Belloq)
                     The tents have been arranged in accor-
                     dance with your radioed instructions,
                     sir.
                                   BELLOQ
                     Good.  We must take the Ark there now.
       Shliemann looks a little unhappy about this exchange, but
       says nothing.  The group moves swiftly toward the
       end of a mine train arrangement.  The train, consisting
       of small, separate, electric-powered cars, sits on a track
       which disappears into a tunnel cut in the rock.
       On the turret of the Wurrfler, the Wurrfler's Captain lights
       a cigarette as he watches the mine train disappear, then
       returns his attention to the activity on the dock.  He leans
       idly against the periscope, his head two feet below Indy's
       dangling whip.  Something catches his eye, he yells an or-
       der and climbs down from the turret to deal with the matter.
       We hold on the whip for a long moment, until its owner's
       hand appears and quickly reclaims it.
138    INT.  TRAIN TUNNEL                                      138
       The Ark and its entourage are moving slowly up the tight
       dark tunnel, their way lit by intermittent lanterns.  The
       tunnel is irregular, but generally about 7 feet wide.  It's
       height varies from an average of about 7 feet to a low of
       only about 4.5 feet at the points (every 40 feet) where sup-
       port beams cross the track.  The result is that there is
       only about a foot of clearance above the mine cars at those
       points; passengers must duck to keep from being hit in the
       head.  Shliemann, looking worried, and Belloq, very excited,
       are focused on the Ark in the car ahead.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     I am uncomfortable with the thought
                     of this--
                              (spitting it out )
                     --Jewish ritual. Are you sure it's
                     necessary?
                                   BELLOQ
                                 (playing him)
                     Let me ask you this--Would you be
                     more comfortable opening the Ark in
                     Berlin--for the Fuhrer--and finding
                     out only them if the sacred pieces
                     of the Covenant are inside?  Knowing,
                     only then, whether you have accom-
                     plished your mission and obtained the
                     one, true Ark?
       Shliemann doesn't like any of his alternatives.  He looks at
       Belloq with some suspicion as the train comes into bright light.
139    INT.  COMMAND CENTER                                    139
       A second natural cavern, even bigger than the first, has been
       worked over by the Germans into a rectangular, three-story
       high supply center around a huge, open, center court.  Uni-
       formed Nazi Soldiers are everywhere, wrangling supplies and
       ammunition, monitoring electronic equipment.  At the far end
       of the court, a second train tunnel disappears into the rock.
       Across the open court, Belloq sees his destination: a large,
       brilliant white silk tent has been erected in the midst of
       all this hardware.  It looks incongruous, and more than a
       little eerie.  It is the Tabernacle.
140    INT.  TRAIN TUNNEL                                      140
       Indy is making his way up the tunnel.  He hears cars coming
       from up ahead and steps into the shadows.  A mine car passes
       with several laughing Nazis.  Indy continues on his way.
141    INT.  THE TABERNACLE                                    141
       The light in here is lovely, unearthly.  Oil lamps burn.
       The Tabernacle is really several concentric, silk tents,
       which creates a flowing maze effect.  The innermost tent
       has at its center a 3-foot high, tapestry-covered altar.
       Belloq watches with gleaming, obsessed eyes as two Nazis
       carefully lift the actual Ark out of its crate by means
       of the long poles.  The Ark dazzles the eye, seeming to
       glow gold in this strange light.  The two Nazis place it
       carefully on the altar.  Shliemann and some Aides hang
       back. Marion is nowhere to be seen.
142    INT.  COMMAND CENTER - END OF TUNNEL                    142
       Indy makes a fast break from the shadows of the tunnel to
       the protection of a high stack of supplies.  He climbs the
       back of the stack, peeks over and surveys the area.
       WHAT HE SEES.  In addition to the Tabernacle, the second
       train tunnel entrance, and all the activity, Indy's glance
       rests momentarily on a large, heavy metal door halfway
       down one wall toward the Tabernacle.  It bears the words,
       in German:  DANGER - MUNITIONS.
       Indy continues to scan the scene.
143    INT.  THE TABERNACLE                                    143
       In the central area with the Ark, Shliemann and the other
       Nazis wait impatiently, eyeing the Ark with some discom-
       fort.  Belloq is not visible, because at the moment he is--
       In the folds of the Tabernacle, the silk of the tents un-
       dulating around him.  The light is even stranger, the scene
       almost dreamlike.  With the help of the Tall Captain, Belloq
       lets an extraordinary, gold-embroidered, ceremonial robe
       fall over his head and onto his body.  Belloq looks trans-
       ported, possessed.  The Tall Captain unlatches a wooden case
       and takes from it a sturdy ivory rod about 5 feet long, elab-
       orately engraved.  Belloq takes it from him, turns and slips
       back through the silk.  The Tall Captain stays in the folds.
       Back in the central area, Shliemann and the other Nazis are
       taken aback by Belloq's appearance in the robe.  They ex-
       change looks.  From one knot of men there is muttering about
       "Juden" and such, but when Belloq turns a fiery gaze on them
       there is immediate silence.  Shliemann looks uncertain in
       this presence.
       Bellow approaches the Ark.  He stops a few feet from it and
       begins murmuring an invocation in Hebrew.  After a few mo-
       ments of this he advances a step and is about to place the
       ivory rod in a notch under the lid of the Ark itself.  The
       end of the rod is an inch from the notch when--
       Indy steps into the Tabernacle.  On his shoulder is a ba-
       zooka and it is aimed directly at the Ark.
                                   INDY
                     Hold it.
                            (the Nazi react)
                     One move from anybody and I blow
                     that box back to Moses.
       Shliemann makes it clear to the other Nazis that Indy is
       to be obeyed.
                                   BELLOQ
                     Jones, your persistence surprises
                     even me.  You are going to give
                     mercenaries a bad name.
                                   INDY
                     What about you?  Talked to God yet?
                         (Belloq's eyes flash)
                     Where's the girl?
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     Doctor Jones, surely you don't think
                     you can escape from this base.
                                   INDY
                     That depends on how reasonable we're
                     all willing to be.  All I want is
                     the girl.  We'll keep possession of
                     the Ark only till we've got safe
                     transport to England.  Then it's
                     all your.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     If we refuse?
                                   INDY
                     Then the Ark and some of us are go-
                     ing up in a big bang.  I don't think
                     Hitler would like that a bit.  Now
                     I don't want to talk about this any-
                     more.  Show me that girl in five
                     seconds or--
       The Tall Captain flies out of the silk and takes Indy down
       by the neck.  The bazooka clatters across the cement floor
       as two other Nazis help subdue Indy.  The three Nazis take
       Indy's pistol from his holster and raise him roughly in
       their grasp.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     Jones, this is the second time I
                     have seen you looking very foolish.
                                   INDY
                     It's a bad habit.  I'm trying to
                     break it.
       Shliemann draws his Luger.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     I'll help you.  This time I'll kill
                     you myself.
       Shliemann raises the pistol.
                                   BELLOQ
                     No!  Not in the presence of the Ark!
                     Take him outside.
       Shliemann eyes Belloq, then the Ark.  He lowers the pistol,
       motions for the Nazis to take Indy out ahead of him.  They
       stop a moment only when Belloq speaks.
                                   BELLOQ
                     Indiana Jones, I salute you.  I am
                     even a little sorry you will miss
                     this moment.
                                   INDY
                     Thanks.  If you talk to Him, tell
                     Him I'm on my way up.
       Shliemann motions them out and follows.  Belloq turns back
       to the Ark, raising the ivory rod.
144    INT.  COMMAND CENTER                                    144
       Shliemann, the Tall Captain, Indy and the two Nazis hold-
       ing him emerge from the Tabernacle.  Shliemann points to
       a nearby wall and the group starts that way with Shlie-
       mann and the Tall Captain slightly ahead.
145    INT.  THE TABERNACLE                                    145
       Belloq has the ivory rod inserted in the notch under the
       lid of the Ark.  He utters a short phrase in Hebrew and
       begins to press down on his end of the rod.  The lid of
       the Ark begins to lift.  It's difficult work.  Belloq puts
       his whole weight into one big press on his end and the
       lid opens two feet.
       Inside the Ark of the Covenant is a preview of the end of
       the world.  A light so bright, a power so fearsome, a
       charge so jolting, that there is nothing in our world to
       compare to it.  It's as though this magnificent golden
       box has been gathering electric energy for three thousand
       years, waiting for just this crack of the lid to release
       it all in one fast, cleansing explosion of pure force.
       Blinding arcs of light shoot out across the Tabernacle
       instantly killing all the Nazis inside and turning the
       white silk to flame.  But it is Belloq in his obsession
       who takes the full blast.  His whole body seems lit by
       a million volt current and, for amoment, his complete
       form is white, then blue, then maybe green, but it is
       hard to tell because our eyes are blinded now too.  Two
       aspects of this ghastly, beautiful display are somehow
       communicated in the chaos, although the communication
       is subliminal.  First, that Belloq, in the instant of
       his destruction, has experienced some kind of sublime,
       transcendental knowledge.  If a death's-head can smile and
       look satisfied, that is how Belloq's incandescent face
       would be described.  Secondly, this event is accompanied
       by a sound like no other.  A sound so intense and so odd
       and so haunting that the suggestible among us might im-
       agine it were the whisper of God.
146    INT.  COMMAND CENTER                                    146
       Choas.  Shliemann and the Tall Captain have been tempo-
       rarily blinded by the light from the Tabernacle.  Indy
       makes short work of his two escorts.  He bashes their
       heads together.  When only one goes down at this, Indy
       uses the handle of his bullwhip, which has appeared in-
       stantly in his hand, to put the second one down.
       Shliemann, hand on his eyes, aims his Luger blindly at
       the scuffle.  Indy pushes the Tall Captain at Shliemann,
       who fires on impact, killing the Tall Captain.  Indy knocks
       out Shliemann.
       Behind Indy, the brilliant light and weird noise of the
       Ark have suddenly ceased, but the Tabernacle is ablaze
       and the fire has quickly apread to stacks of supplies on
       either side.  Smoke is already starting to fill the cavern.
       Nazis are running around, yelling for firefighting water.
       A burning crate at the side of the Tabernacle is pushed
       over, only to knock over a drum of heavy black oil.  A
       river of flame shoots across the cement.
       Indy grabs a rifle with bayonet from the prostrate body
       of one of his former escorts and runs back into the flaming
       Tabernacle.
147    INT.  THE TABERNACLE                                    147
       Indy jumps through the flames into what is now a tent of
       fire.  He looks around at the dead bodies, then at the Ark.
       The lid has slammed down shut again and the Ark shines gold
       in the flames.  Before it, where Belloq once stood, is a
       pile of ash and charred debris.  Indy registers this, then
       continues to scan the scene.
                                   INDY
                     Marion!  Marion, can you hear me?
       Suddenly, Indy looks as--
       The far side of the Tabernacle burns completely away, re-
       vealing Marion, tied spread-eagle between two upright posts.
       Her nightgown is now in tatters, black with soot.  She is
       gagged, but her eyes are screaming, focused on the flaming
       river of black oil which is about to engulf her feet.
       Indy rushes toward her, unaware of a uniformed Nazi who
       has appeared from the flames.  Marion looks up to see
       Indy and the Nazi leveling his submachine gun at Indy.
       She motions desperately with her eyes.  Indy dives and
       rolls through the flames just as the Nazi opens fire.
       From the floor, Indy blasts the Nazi.
       The river of burning oil is only a foot from Marion.
       Indy jumps up and runs toward the bound Marion, his bayo-
       net aimed directly at her.  Her wide eyes flash between
       the flames and the shining balde.  Ecpertly, Indy slashes
       down both sides at Marion, cutting all four bindings.  Mar-
       ion falls backwards, away from the flames, but before she
       hits the ground, Indy is there, catching her in his arms.
       They embrace.  They kiss.  They break.
                                   INDY
                     Hi.
                                   MARION
                     Oh, Indy!  Thank god you're here.
                                   INDY
                     Glad I could make it.
       Indy rises, pulling her up with him.  The Tabernacle is
       burning away so fast that soon Indy and Marion will be
       completely exposed.  Indy rushes over and grabs the sub-
       machine gun and a Luger from the dead Nazi.
                                   INDY
                     Let's get out of here.
                                   MARION
                     What about the Ark?
       Ondy stops, startled by her spunky attitude.  He's con-
       sidering their changes.
                                   INDY
                     Are you game?
                                   MARION
                     Hell yes!  We've made it this far.
                                   INDY
                                (grins at her)
                     Okay.  Let's do it.
       They approach the altar through the dying flames, Indy
       slinging the submachine gun over hsi back.  The long
       carrying poles are still in place.
                                   INDY
                     Whatever you do, don't touch it.
                     Let's put it on the floor.
       Marion nods.  Each taking an end with the poles, they lift
       the Ark from the altar and lower it to the floor.  Marion
       grunts under the weight.  Indy registers this, hands her
       the submachine gun.  He pulls out hsi whip, motions her
       back, and sweeps the whip tightly around the body of the
       Ark.  The fall wraps snugly around the plaiting and Indy
       ties it off.  The Ark is now harnessed to the whip handle.
       Indy gives it an experimental pull and the Ark slides across
       the smooth cement.  Indy indicates the direction of the
       second train tunnel.
                                   INDY
                     We'll go down that side.  Shoot any-
                     one who looks at us crosseyed.
148    INT.  COMMAND CENTER                                    148
       Two huge stacks of goods are ablaze and the Nazis are having
       trouble getting water to them.  The Nazis main concern at
       this point is an enormous, neat stack of wooden cartridge
       boxes which are piled down the wall from one of the already
       blazing, and now teetering, stacks of general goods.  Ner-
       vous Nazis are moving the heavy cartridge boxes as fast as
       they can, but it's slow work and the threatening fire is
       close.
       Indy and Marion make their way along the side of the center
       court, Indy grimacing with the strain of pulling the Ark.
       One Nazi stops directly in front of them, looking at them
       queerly.  Indy knocks his out with the butt of his Luger
       just as Marion is about to fire.
       Out in the court, Shliemann has regained his eyesight.  Now
       he crouches, scanning the scene desperately for Indy.  He
       looks into the remains of the Tabernacle and spots the empty
       altar.  Beyond it, the unoccupied posts where Marion was
       bound.
       At the entrance to the second train tunnel, Indy and Marion
       struggle to lift the Ark into a mine car.  Marion has the
       submachine gun slung over her back.  The Ark drops heavily
       into the bottom of the car.  The noise attracts the attention
       of five water-carrying Nazis.  They see what's going on and
       reach for their side-arms. Indy grabs Marion, pulls her in
       front of him--as though to use her as a shield--and flips
       the submachine gun, still on her back, toward the Nazis.
       He opens fire, turning Marion's body so he can mow all
       five down.
       Shliemann spins around and looks at the tunnel entrance.
       He points at Indy and Marion, who have just hopped into the
       mine car with the Ark.
                                   SHLIEMANN
                     Stop them!  Kill them!
       A dozen Nazis spin and look at the mine car.  Marion is just
       leveling the submachine gun.  Indy pushes forward the throttle
       and the mine car moves toward the tunnel, picking up speed.
       As the Nazis raise their guns to fire, Marion and Indy both
       open up, peppering the area with lead.  As the mine car is
       about to disappear into the tunnel--
                                   INDY
                                (to Marion)
                     Get down!
       As the car disappears, bullets pock the entrance of the
       tunnel.  Shliemann runs up with three Nazis.  They jump
       into the next mine car and take off, disappearing into
       the tunnel.
       Over at the burning stack of goods, some terrified fire-
       fighters scurry away as the burning pile of general goods
       falls over onto the stack of cartridge boxes.  The wooden
       boxes immediately start burning.  Many of the Nazis just
       want to get out of there, but a couple of disciplined OF-
       FICERS are trying to salvage the situation.  They point to
       the far side of the court, the walls are lines with oil
       and gas drums.
                                   OFFICER
                     We must cover the drums!  Protect
                     them from the bullets!
149    INTERCUTTING Indy and Marion with Shliemann and the Nazis,
       we see a most extraordinary pursuit.  This tunnel is of
       identical design to the first, except more twisty.  This
       early section goes slightly uphill, as though headed for
       the summit of a rollercoaster.  The low cross beams and
       the higher sections in between are causing the Nazis to
       alternately stand and duck in their efforts to get a
       clear shot at the lead car.  One German times it wrong and
       gets whacked.  Indy in unhappy with the speed of his car
       and he's right, the Nazis are moving faster and gaining.
       When both cars are in the same high section, the Nazis blast
       away at them.  The noise is deafening, with barking guns,
       splintering rock, and twanging ricochets contributing to
       the din.  As Marion fires a return volley low over the Ark,
       Indy kicks at the throttle, convinced it is jammed.
150    INT.  COMMAND CENTER                                    150
       The Officers are directing the placement of every move-
       able item in front of the oil drums.  Desks, crates, chairs,
       food, all are heaped in front of the fuel. All the workers

       cast frequent nervous glances back at the burning cartridge
       boxes across the court.  Suddenly the worst begins to hap-
       pen at the cartridge boxes.  Hundreds of thousands of live
       cartridges begin exploding, flying around the court like
       shrapnel.  Hot lead begins to zing off the exposed fuel
       drums, leaving big dents.
151    INT.  TRAIN TUNNEL - LONG STRAIGHTAWAY                  151
       The car with Indy and Marion looks almost sluggish com-
       pared to the pursuing Nazi car as they both make their way
       into an usually long straightaway.  Marion discards her
       empty submachine gun as Indy kicks at his throttle and casts
       a worried look back at Shliemann.
       Shliemann, sensing victory, smiles evilly and carefully
       takes aim.  Indy and Marion will be easy targets until they
       reach that approaching low cross beam, which is the crest
       of the rising tunnel.
152    INT.  COMMAND CENTER - CLOSE ON FUEL DRUM               152
       A fuel drum, already pocked by bullets is finally pene-
       trated by high velocity hot lead.  It explodes in a ball
       of flame.  And then its neighbor.  Then all is exploding
       flame.
153    INT.  TRAIN TUNNEL - LONG STRAIGHTAWAY                  153
       Shliemann and his cohorts hear the explosions behind them
       and look back that way.
       Indy kicks the throttle one more time and it goes!  Their
       car doubles its speed and shoots under the low cross beam
       at the same instant as--
       A huge dragon of all-consuming fire shoots up the tunnel
       behind the Nazis, catches their car and incinerates
       Shliemann and his men.  The tunnel collapses in this section,
       burying the fried Nazis forever.
154    INT.  TRAIN TUNNEL                                      154
       Indy and Marion look back at the low cross beam as the last
       tongue of flame makes it there and then is doused by falling
       rock and dirt.  They look at each other, then turn their
       attention back to their own predicament.  Their mine car is
       going incredible fast as it moves into a downward section
       of wildly twisting tunnel.
                                   MARION
                     Slow it down!
       Indy is already pulling the throttle.  It moves easily.
       Unfortunately, it is no longer attached to the motor.  The
       mine car is out of control.  After several moments, far
       ahead, appears a circle of bright daylight-- the end of the
       tunnel!  It approaches at a frightening rate.  Indy reaches
       out and grasps Marion's hand.  They exchange looks and then
       turn to look ahead.
       THEIR POV.  We're taking this last stretch with them.  It's
       a familiar nightmare.  It has to do with a rollercoaster
       that ends suddenly and disastrously.  The shocking bright-
       ness of sunlight rushes up to engulf us, blinding us in
       its glare.
155    EXT.  THE ISLAND - END OF TRACKS, DOCK                  155
       High up on the slope of the island, Indy and Marion's mine
       car shoots out of the black tunnel and roars down toward
       a little dock at the end of the tracks.
       A small Nazi transport launch, carefully disguised as a
       Greek fishing boat, sits bobbing by the dock.  The only
       human:  a Nazi Sentry dressed as a Greek peasant.  He is
       perched on a pile of seed bags which are stacked at the
       very end of the train tracks.  As the mine car barrels
       noisily down toward him, he throws away some burlap to
       reveal a mounted machine gun which he spins quickly around
       toward the approaching mine car.  He opens fire.
       In the out-of-control mine car, Indy pulls Marion down with
       him.  They are squashed into the corner trying to avoid con-
       tact with the bounching Ark.  Bullets clang against the out-
       side of the car and whiz inches overhead.  Indy and Marion
       are forced into a tighter and tighter embrace of life.
       At the machine gun post, the Nazi Sentry has been firing
       like crazy, but now there is terror in his eyes.  He
       realizes the car is not going to stop.  He lacks faith in
       his stronghold.  Too late.
       The mine car smashes into the seed bag bunker.  And right
       on through.  The Nazi Sentry, his machine gun and a dozen
       bursting seed bags are slammed into the ocean in a wild,
       hurtling mass.  The mine car jumps, bounces and spins around,
       then slides to a stop in a cloud of seed at the edge of the
       water.
156    INT.  COMMAND CENTER                                    156
       Fire.  Everywhere.  No sign of life.  A large gaping door-
       way, flames ringing it, blazing into the room beyond.  Hang-
       ing by one hinge there, its metal blasted and jagged, is a
       heavy door with the signed lettering, in German, DANGER -
       MUNITIONS.
       The first explosion happens.  It's a baby compared to what's
       coming yet is rocks the earth.  It's terrible.  And then,
       almost immediately, another.  The long, irregular, ever-
       larger chain of explosions begins.
157    EXT.  THE ISLAND - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                  157
       The island rumbles and shakes.  From fissures and small
       natural caves, dirt and rock shoot out like spraying water.
       Still the explosion continue.  A huge chuck of white cliff
       falls away into the turbulent sea.  Birds scream and soar,
       afraid to land.
       Finally, we settle on a full shot of the island.  We can
       recognize that the small opening high on the slope from
       which a cloud of smoke and dust is billowing is the end
       of the mine tunnel.  And there below it, quite small from
       this distance is the dock.  And the boat that looks like
       a Greek fishing boat.  There can be no mistake even from
       this far away--the boat is chugging out to sea.
158    INT.  THE PENTAGON - DAY                                158
       Indy, Brody, and Marion, looking very stylish, are seated
       in Colonel Musgrove's huge office.  Sun pours in a window,
       through which Washington can be seen sparkling across the
       Potomac.  Everything is neat and clean and regular.  In-
       cluding the three men who are arrayed around the office.
       Two we know--Col. Musgrove and Maj. Eaton.  The third is
       an unnamed Bureaucrat.  He hangs back, smiling and genial,
       his features obscured by the glare of the window.  He doesn't
       say anything, yet you have a sense that the others defer to
       him in the matter at hand.  He is the essence of all that
       is Byzantine and inscrutable in our scrubbed government
       machine.
       Indy and Brody are dissatisfied with the way the meeting
       has gone.  Marion, on the other hand, is very happy and
       eager to get out of there.  Eaton's manner is irritatingly
       cheery.
                                   MUSGROVE
                     You've done your country a great
                     service.
                                   EATON
                     --And we trust you found the settle-
                     ment satisfactory?
                                   MARION
                     Quite.
                                   EATON
                     Good, good.
                         (glances around at the others)
                     Then I guess that about does it.
                                   BRODY
                     When can we have the Ark?
       Eaton's glance flicks over to the mysterious Bureaucrat,
       then back to Brody.
                                   EATON
                     I thought we answered that.  It's
                     someplace very safe--
                                   INDY
                                  (heated)
                     That's a powerful force.  Research
                     should be done--
                                   EATON
                     Oh, it will be, Dr. Jones, I assure
                     you.  We have top men working on it
                     right now.
                                   INDY
                     Who?
                                   EATON
                     Top men.
       Indy exchanges a look with Brody.
                                   INDY
                     We may be able to help.
                                   EATON
                     We appreciate that.  And we won't
                     hesitate to call on you.
                                   MUSGROVE
                            (dismissing them)
                     Thank you all.  Thank you again.
       Indy looks them over coldly.  He gets up, sullen.
159    EXT.  PENTAGON STEPS - DAY                              159
       Indy, Brody and Marion emerge from the building.  Brody
       bids them farewell and moves off in another direction.
       Marion clings to Indy's arm in an energetic, very feminine
       way, scolding him.
                                   MARION
                     --Well they aren't going to tell
                     you, so why don't you just forget
                     it.  I'd think you'd has enough
                     of that damn Ark.  Just put your
                     mind on something else.
       Indy stops, looking across the river, his mind occupied.
                                   INDY
                     Yeah, like what?
       Marion makes a face, then puts her arms around his neck
       and plants a humdinger of a kiss on his mouth.  It goes
       on a while.  Finally they break.
                                   INDY
                     It's not the Ark...but it'll have
                     to do.
       They move down the steps, smiling.
160    INT.  GOVERNMENT WAREHOUSE                              160
       The Ark of the Covenant sits in a wooden crate.  A wooden
       lid comes down and hides it from view.  The lid is solidly
       nailed to the crate as we read the stenciled message on top--
                                  TOP SECRET
                             ARMY INTEL. #9906753
                                 DO NOT OPEN!
       The hammering is completed and hands shift the heavy crate
       onto a dolly.
       THE END CREDITS ROLL AS WE SEE--
       A Little Old Government Warehouseman begin pushing the
       crated Ark down as aisle.  Soon we see that the aisle is
       formed by huge stacks or crates.  They come in many shapes
       and sizes, but when it comes right down to it, they all
       look like the one that holds the Ark.  All have markings
       like the message we've just seen.  Pretty soon we're far
       enough and high enough away from the Little Old Government
       Warehouseman to see that this is one of the biggest rooms
       in the world.  And it is full.  Crates and crates.  All
       looking alike.  All gathering dust.
       And then we notice that the Little Old Government Ware-
       houseman, pushing his new crate ahead of him, has turned

       into another aisle and disappeared from view.
                                                        FADE OUT.
                               THE END
